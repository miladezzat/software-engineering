<p>In this week's episode, Abbey chats with artist and game developer Angela He. She's a college student at Stanford University. </p><p>Angela creates digital art and develops video games that speak to emotional issues. She has more than a dozen games in the Steam store. And she's almost completely self-taught.</p><p>Angela grew up in a suburb of Washington, D.C., and started studying art at the tender age of 3 (after her parents found her drawing on the walls of their home). From there, she has worked with and learned about all different kinds of art, and has taught herself much of what she knows.</p><p>As she grew older, she got into game development and started figuring out what sort of games - and art - her peers and the general public might like. When she came to Stanford to start university, she continued to explore new tech and expand her skills.</p><p>Now, Angela is launching a clothing and accessories line inspired by her art while going to school and landing internships at companies like Microsoft and Niantic (the Pok√©mon Go company). She loves exploring the Bay Area with her friends, enjoys shopping for house plants, and eventually wants to write an anime, among many other things.</p><p>This interview is a 1 hour listen in your favorite podcast player app - just search "freecodecamp" and you should find it.</p><p>If you have an Amazon Echo, you can just say "Alexa - play the freeCodeCamp podcast."</p><p>Or you can listen to it <a href="http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-67-digital-artist-game-developer-and-entrepreneurial-college-student">right here in your browser</a>.</p><p>You can find <a href="https://twitter.com/zephybite">Angela on twitter here</a>.</p><p>And you can <a href="https://softy-shop.com/#/">check out her website here</a>.</p>
