<p>5 years ago, Mattias Petter Johansson – better known as MPJ – was already a well-known developer.</p>
<p>He had made a name for himself by answering hundreds of coding questions <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Mattias-Petter-Johansson/answers">on Quora</a>. And he had gone from theater student to prolific developer, having built a product that was acquired by Blackberry.</p>
<p>So in the summer of 2015, MPJ was working at the height of his field as a front-end developer at Spotify in his native Sweden.</p>
<p>And that's when he decided – seemingly out of nowhere – to launch a programming YouTube channel. </p>
<p>I distinctly remember sitting in my parent's living room with some hot tea when his first video went live. And of course I clicked on it. Because how can you not click on a video called Fun Fun Function?</p>
<p>"Hello!" MPJ shouted exuberantly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk">in his first video</a>. "In this video series, I will teach you how to do functional programming in JavaScript."</p>
<p>Little did any of us know at the time that this "video series" would stretch on for 5 years, span more than 200 episodes, and ultimately become MPJ's full-time focus.</p>
<h2 id="gifting-the-developer-community-a-trove-of-coding-fun">Gifting The Developer Community a Trove of Coding Fun</h2>
<p>In addition to functional programming, MPJ covered lots of other programming topics.</p>
<figcaption>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pmGFGoiyUI">video on Lua</a>, a popular language for game development that is frequently taught in high schools.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Throughout the show, there were two reliable fixtures: MPJ's high energy, and his ever-changing hair color.</p>
<figcaption>Redux creator and React maintainer Dan Abramov came on Fun Fun Function to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-aO5hzo1aw">discuss React Hooks with MPJ</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Over the years, MPJ did cross-overs with some of the most exciting teachers in tech.</p>
<figcaption>An episode where MPJ teamed up with coding live-streamer and mechanical keyboard aficionado Noopkat to do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkn-GzSksYA">LED strip hardware hacking with JavaScript</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>He also shared lots of insights around how to break into the field of software development, and how to continue to progress with your career.</p>

<p>So today, it was with mixed emotions that I watched his final video.</p>
<p>If you have 15 minutes, I encourage you to watch the video – even if you've never watched his channel before. Because this is a master class in how you responsibly and decisively bow out of a long-running project.</p>

<p>I probably learned more about MPJ and what kind of person he is from this video than I did from all his other zany, thoughtful videos combined.</p>
<h2 id="no-matter-how-good-you-are-you-can-still-get-better">No matter how good you are, you can still get better</h2>
<p>MPJ is a passionate developer who loves coding and loves teaching. All of this shines through in his videos. But he is also someone who sees his life's work as largely unfinished.</p>
<p>He has the humility to realize the limits of his own abilities, and to continue exploring and expanding past them.</p>
<p>As he explains in his final video:</p>
<blockquote><em>"When I started Fun Fun Function I was still at Spotify, and it was a little bit of an outlet for me to talk about musings while I was at Spotify building.</em><br><br><em>And when I went full time [on Fun Fun Function], all I was doing was talking about creating – not actually creating. When I did create, it was tools that facilitated creation – Twitch overlays and stuff like that.</em><br><br><em>Don't get me wrong, this was an amazing way to spend my time. I heard from thousands of people how I've helped them become better and more inspired developers by sharing my passion and knowledge with the world. </em><br><br><em>But I think that now, 5 years later, I'm out of things to share.</em><br><br><em>I've shared all of the stuff that I learned during my time working as a programmer. And I've also lost a little bit of the passion for the craft itself, like coding. And so I can't really contribute with much enthusiasm either at this point. </em><br><br><em>So now it's time for me to go back to the place where you all are."</em></blockquote>
<h2 id="a-higher-calling">A Higher Calling</h2>
<p>Most importantly, MPJ wants to play a part in addressing an important challenge facing humanity – the challenge of mental health.</p>
<p>He explains:</p>
<blockquote>"I want to go back to building products, putting things out into the world, and spend some time thinking about what it is that I care about. What is it that I should be creating?<br><br>I care about a lot of things. But one thing that sticks out lately is psychology and mental health. <br><br>I don't talk much about this on the channel, but when I was in my late teens, my mother committed suicide. It was after a very long battle with chronic depression and addiction to benzodiazepines.<br><br>During the last year or so I've been going to therapy myself, facing a lot of inner demons that have been there for many many years. And as I've done this I've realized what a big, interesting, important problem mental health is. I've grown the opinion that mental health is an area that way more people should be working on. <br><br>Globally more than 800,000 people commit suicide every year. In almost all countries, suicide is a more common way to die than homicide – sometimes 10 or 20 times more. Every 40 seconds someone commits suicide."</blockquote>
<p>We may not get any more Fun Fun Function videos, but it is heartening to know that people like MPJ are out there working hard on the big problems facing humanity.</p>
<p>And I will always be grateful for the many insights MPJ has left us with.</p>
