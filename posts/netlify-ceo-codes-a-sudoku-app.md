<p>Netlify CEO Matt Biilmann live-codes a Sudoku app using Netlify in this tutorial video. Matt shows how simple and quick it can be to create a working app using the JAMstack.</p>
<p>Matt starts with the create-react-app-lambda boilerplate and then builds Sudoku using React and Netlify. He explains and teaches along the way. We recorded this during the 2018 freeCodeCamp JAMstack Hackathon.</p>
<p>Matt co-founded Netlify in 2014. He's raised more than $44 million in venture capital funding. But he hasn't lost his coding chops.</p>
<p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GytUZLK4kwA">full video on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel</a> (1.5 hour watch).</p>
