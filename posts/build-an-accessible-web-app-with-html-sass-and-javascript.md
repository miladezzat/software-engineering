<p>Are you looking for another web app project to build? Are you interested in incorporating accessibility into your websites? Do you want to learn more about creating mobile-first apps?</p>
<p>If you answered "yes" to any of those questions, you're going to like this new tutorial we just released on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will build a To Do list app with HTML, Sass, and plain vanilla JavaScript. Your app will be responsive, with mobile-first in mind.</p>
<p>The app will also be built with accessibility (A11y) in mind for keyboard navigation and screen readers. You will also use the Web Storage API to create a persistent data store so the list items reappear any time we visit the web app.</p>
<p>This tutorial was created by Dave Gray. Dave is a university instructor who teaches web development. He also has a YouTube channel with many excellent tutorials.</p>
<p>Here are the topics Dave covers in this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML foundation</li>
<li>SASS / CSS styles</li>
<li>Javascript Classes</li>
<li>Javascript Functions</li>
<li>Testing the Accessibility features</li>
<li>Code clean up and enhancements for A11y</li>
<li>Testing the fixes &amp; enhancements for the app</li>
<li>Imroving the app</li>
</ul>
