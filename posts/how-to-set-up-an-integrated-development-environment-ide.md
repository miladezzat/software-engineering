cd my-app
npm start</code></pre><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app</a></figcaption></figure><p>The first line basically says: "Hey, NPM! Download all the dependencies for Create React App, and put them in a folder called 'my-app.'"</p><p>The second line then tells your CLI: "Navigate to the new directory called 'my-app.'"</p><p>The third line gets the action going: "NPM, it's me again. Start a development server that displays my project in a browser and updates it whenever I make changes to the code."</p><p>Once you've installed all of the necessary dependencies using your package manager, you'll begin working in your code editor and using the command line interface to make pull requests or push code to a remote repository using your version control system.</p><p>In summary, an integrated development environment comprises all of the things you need to get your work done, and varies based on language, project type, and your personal preference. &nbsp;Ordinarily, IDEs include a code editor (and compiler), command line interface, version control system, and package manager, but your integrated development environment might have different requirements or a combination thereof.</p><p>You can do it!</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, please consider <a href="https://www.nightpathpub.com/">checking out my games and books</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/msfarzan?sub_confirmation=1">subscribing to my YouTube channel</a>, or <a href="https://discord.gg/RF6k3nB">joining the <em>Entromancy </em>Discord</a>.</p><p><strong><strong>M.
