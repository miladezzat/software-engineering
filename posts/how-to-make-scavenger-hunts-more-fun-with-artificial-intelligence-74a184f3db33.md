}</code></pre><p>The response contains an array of labels applicable to the photo, and a confidence interval for each. In this game I was looking for a “Lamp” and the service identified it being in the photo with 85% certainty. The scorekeeper credited me for finding it!</p><h4 id="amazon-commoditizes-image-processing">Amazon Commoditizes Image Processing</h4><p>The value of the Rekognition service is its simplicity. Amazon has already trained the machine learning models to recognize many objects. All I need to do to use the service is to call the API with the address of the object I want scanned. That’s making a very powerful service simple, and inexpensive. If I scan 1,000 images, it costs me $1. This enables me to focus on creating the user experience, including exciting gameplay.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>I enjoy playing this modern version of scavenger hunter with my family. It’s fun to run around the yard taking pictures of things in the house and neighborhood, then checking back in with Alexa on what items it matches. Please give it a try and let me know what you think!</p><blockquote>“Oh, the places you’ll go! There is fun to be done!<br>There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.<br>And the magical things you can do with that ball<br>will make you the winning-est winner of all.”<br><br>— <strong>Dr. Seuss</strong>, <strong>Oh, The Places You’ll Go!</strong></blockquote>
