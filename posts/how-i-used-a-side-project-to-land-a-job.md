I needed to show I could scrape stock data as well as do something with the data. I didn't want to overcomplicate the project. But I also wanted to include enough analysis to impress potential employers. </p><p>After a month of work, I came up with a Python script that did the following:</p><ul><li>Scrape and append three companies' stock prices to a CSV file over the course of 30 days</li><li>Import the CSV as a dataframe and calculate the average price for each stock for the last 30 days</li><li>Visualize the change in stock price for each company using matplotlib</li></ul><p>When I bought a new computer I forgot to save the actual script. Here is some pseudocode in case any of you wanted to reproduce what I did:</p><pre><code class="language-Python">#import libraries
import pandas as pd
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
import math
import numpy as np
#Scrape and append three companies' stock prices to a pandas dataframe over the course of 30 days
#1) Scrape stock prices for Company A, Company B, and Company C
#2) Append each stock price for the day to a separate column within a CSV using ExcelWriter (pandas function)
#3) Include a single column in the CSV for the date
#4) Repeat until you have 30 days' worth of data for each company
#Calculate the average price for each stock over the course of the 30 days in the dataframe
#1) Import CSV file back into the script as a dataframe
#2) Generate basic statistics (describe() function) for each column or use the .mean() function if you're looking for just the average
#Visualize the average stock price over the last 30 days using matplotlib
#1) Create a different Time Series line plot for Company A, Company B, and Company C
