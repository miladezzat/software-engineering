<p>The Python programming language is very capable when it comes to networking. We've released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdiSJakIS4">crash course</a> on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will help you learn the basics of networking in Python.</p><p>This course was developed by Neural Nine. You will learn the networking principles of Python by building the following networking projects:</p><ul><li>Mailing Client</li><li>DDOS Script</li><li>Port Scanner</li><li>TCP Chat Room</li></ul><p>These projects will give you a good introduction to what Python is capable of when it comes to networking. A lot of the basics will be taught through the Mailing Client application. The Chat Room application will help you learn how to interact with TCP. The DDOS Script and Port Scanner will teach you basic penetration testing. &nbsp;</p><p>You can watch the course on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGdiSJakIS4">freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel</a> (1 hour watch). </p>
