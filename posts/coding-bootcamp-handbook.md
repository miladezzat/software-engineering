</code></pre><p>If you get paid $80,000 per year:</p><pre><code>($80,000 * 17% = $13,600) * 2 years = $27,400 total
</code></pre><p>If you get paid $100,000 per year:</p><pre><code>($100,000 * 17% = $17,000) * 2 years = $34,000 total
</code></pre><p>Most of these ISAs won't kick in until you make at least US $50,000 per year. And if you earn less than $50,000 per year for five years, these ISAs will go away and you won't owe anything anymore. And some ISAs have a "cap" - a maximum amount you have to pay back.</p><p>But the important thing to note with ISAs is they are a new form of debt. Unlike other forms of consumer debt - like student loans - ISAs exist in a legal gray area.</p><p>ISAs are a new form of "financial engineering". They seem to be legal, but none of this has been tested in a court of law.</p><p>It's also unclear what happens if you take out an ISA, and then the bootcamp goes bankrupt. (This happens often - even to big bootcamp chains). You would have no control over who gains ownership over your debt. It's unclear how aggressively they could pursue you to pay them back.</p><p>So again, <strong>do your research</strong>.</p><h2 id="how-much-are-living-expenses-during-a-bootcamp">How much are living expenses during a bootcamp?</h2><p>Your living expenses will depend on which city the bootcamp is in, and that city's cost of living.</p><p>Living at home with your parents in the midwest? Your costs will be much lower than if you are moving to San Francisco and renting an apartment.</p><p>You should save enough money to last you through the bootcamp, plus 6 months. This way, you have enough time to find the right job and to cash your first paycheck.</p><h2 id="what-is-opportunity-cost">What is "opportunity cost"?</h2><p>Opportunity Cost is a concept from economics that roughly means "foregone earnings."</p><p>To get the true cost of attending a coding bootcamp, you should factor in opportunity cost as well.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: You currently earn $3,000 per month. You're moving to San Francisco, where it can cost $2,000 per month just to rent a bedroom. You'll attend a 12-week bootcamp that costs $15,000.</p><p>Here is your true cost, assuming an additional 6 months until you get a job and cash your first pay check:</p><pre><code>Bootcamp Tuition: $15,000
Cost of Living: (9 months * $2,000) = $18,000
Opportunity Cost of Foregone Wages: (9 months * $3,000) = $27,000
