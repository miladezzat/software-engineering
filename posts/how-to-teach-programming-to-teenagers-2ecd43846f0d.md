<p>By Sean Choi</p><p>In the past, many enthusiastic parents have approached me and asked me how I learned to code in the beginning — mainly with the interest in finding ways to help their children how to code. And every time, I didn’t have a clear answer for them, because I learned to code at a much later age than most of the children of these parents. In the interest of helping these parents, I also tried to find resources that are made to help the children learn to code.</p><p>I discovered that there are a lot of resources help K-6 students learn how to code. Some examples include <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/about" rel="noopener nofollow">Scratch</a> and the Hour of Code in <a href="https://code.org/" rel="noopener nofollow">Code.org</a> which are quite useful for someone new to get acquainted with programming.</p><p>Through these platforms, students write simple programs that make graphical creatures move or build simple games and learn the basic tools of programming — such as loops and conditionals — while building useful problem-solving skills. The major strength of these platforms is the visual feedback from the platform, which really helps the students stay constantly engaged with the curriculum and the exercises.</p><p>However, teaching programming to teenagers over the 6th grade is a completely different beast. <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/new-research-finds-95-teens-access-smartphone-45-online-almost-constantly/" rel="noopener nofollow">This article</a> shows that over 95% of teenagers today have access to smartphones. So, the visual feedback from Scratch or Code.org no longer wows them. In fact, I discovered that the teenagers actually find them quite mundane and childish.</p><p>Instead, teenagers want to build or do something <em><em>REAL </em></em>that they can showcase. Such as building and launching a real iPhone app or their own website or hacking into some system. But how can you get someone who just finished a set of Scratch exercises to building an iPhone app, while getting them constantly engaged to finish it?</p><p>So, I wanted to share my experiences in teaching programming to 4 teenagers over the course of two years. The students started out having a different range of programming skills, personalities, and expectations. Therefore, to keep everyone engaged, I had to go through various trials to find the teaching materials that worked for everyone.</p><p>The main goal of this article is to share what I learned and the trials that were successful, in the hopes of helping other teenagers learn to love programming.</p><h1 id="teenagers-have-high-expectations">Teenagers have High Expectations</h1><p>I learned that teenagers absorb new technology like dry sponges. While adults may be quite okay with being a technically bit out-of-date, teenagers bet their lives on being cool and following the latest trend out there. I found that teenagers tend to use the coolest and latest apps even before they make it to TechCrunch or CNBC headlines.</p><p>In fact, it was my students who introduced me to a bunch of <a href="https://www.crazygames.com/c/io" rel="noopener nofollow">.io games</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HQ_Trivia" rel="noopener nofollow">HQ Trivia</a>. So, it’s important that what they learn is <em><em>COOL</em></em>, and something that they can share with their friends.</p><p>The first thing they asked when I started the programming class was “Can we Hack stuff? Like websites and iPhone APPs?”.</p><p>So, I told them we should first learn HTML and CSS to learn how to hack a website and showed them this:</p><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Hello World!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
