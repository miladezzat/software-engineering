<p>Some of these extensions are paid, but there are tons of quality options that are available for free in the VS Code Marketplace.</p>
<p>In this article, I will be sharing 10 of the free ones for your reading pleasure. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="1vscodeautorenametag">1. VS Code Auto Rename Tag</h2>
<p>This extension lets you rename both opening and closing tags once. This means that wherever you choose to rename from – either the opening or the closing tag – you don’t have to go back to the other tag to do the same thing. It's just automatically renamed for you.</p>

<h2 id="2prettierinvscode">2. Prettier in VS Code</h2>
<p>The name “Prettier” is pretty self-explanatory – this extension makes your code prettier by formatting it in a very readable way.</p>
<p>You can choose to either format your code on save or paste.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/prettier.gif" alt="prettier"></p>
<h2 id="3convertpixelstoreminvscode">3. Convert Pixels to Rem in VS Code</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might want your units to be in rem (root em) instead of pixels (px) and vice versa.</p>
<p>Good news – you don’t need to do mathematical conversions yourself because that’s what this extension does for you.</p>
<p>To convert from rem to px and vice versa, press and hold the alt + z keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/pxtoem.gif" alt="pxtoem"></p>
<h2 id="4vscodeflexboxcheatsheet">4. VS Code Flexbox Cheatsheet</h2>
<p>The Flexbox cheatsheet extension brings a handy Flexbox cheatsheet right into VS Code.</p>
<p>You can use it in two ways: by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows and Cmd + Shift + P on Mac to pop it up, or you can simply hover over anywhere the display is set to flex.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/flex.gif" alt="flex"></p>
<h2 id="5gridsnippetsvscodeextension">5. Grid Snippets VS Code Extension</h2>
<p>The Grid Snippets extension gives you the ability to code in CSS Grid with simple shortcuts that bring in the snippets for you.</p>
<p>Some of these shortcuts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>dg – display grid</li>
<li>dig – display inline-grid</li>
<li>gg – grid gap</li>
<li>gtc – grid-template-columns</li>
<li>gta – grid-template-areas</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many other shortcuts available in the docs.</p>

<h2 id="6bracketpaircolorizer">6. Bracket Pair Colorizer</h2>
<p>It's easy to get confused by braces in our code. This bracket pair colorizer alleviates that confusion by assigning different colors to braces (brackets, curly braces, square brackets).</p>
<p>You can see in the screenshot below that all the braces have different colors so you can keep track of which are which.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/bracket.png" alt="bracket"></p>
<h2 id="7liveserverextensioninvscode">7. Live Server Extension in VS Code</h2>
<p>Gone are the days when we all had to reload the browser to see the changes we made to our code.</p>
<p>These days, all you have to do is install the Live Server extension from the VS Code Marketplace, and boom! Every change you make is immediately updated in the browser.</p>
<p>The file you open with Live Server has to be the HTML file. Also, the HTML file must have opening and closing head and body tags.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/liveserver.gif" alt="liveserver"></p>
<h2 id="8vscodeicons">8. VS Code Icons</h2>
<p>VS Code icons is one of my favorite extensions. With it, you get to see your file icon represented in the language or framework/library in which you are coding.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/vscideicons.gif" alt="vscideicons"></p>
<h2 id="9polacode">9. Polacode</h2>
<p>This extension is a very interesting one to work with. It lets you take beautiful screenshots of your code.</p>
<p>To take a screenshot you just press Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows and Cmd + Shift + P on Mac to bring in the command palette. Then you can search “Polacode” and select it. Just highlight the part you want to screenshot<br>
and press the camera-like icon to take the screenshot and save it on your device.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2021/08/polacode.gif" alt="polacode"></p>
<h2 id="10codetime">10. Code Time</h2>
<p>Code time is an extension that helps you track your progress and metrics right inside VS Code.</p>
<p>But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With this super cool extension, you can mute notifications, connect a Slack workspace and set your presence to away, get to know your coding uptime, your progress, and much more.</p>
<p>In addition, you can also invite your team members, which will help you discover the impact of meetings or any other activity.</p>
<p>You get a little feet-like icon when it is installed. From there, you can explore all the features. Surprisingly, it is not paid – it's free!</p>
