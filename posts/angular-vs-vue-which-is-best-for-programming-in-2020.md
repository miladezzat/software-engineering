}</code></pre><p>When compared to Angular, there is one change in variable declaration in Vue. We use the equals (=) symbol to assign values in Angular, where as in Vue, you need to use a colon (:).</p><h3 id="variable-declaration-syntax-in-vue-js">Variable Declaration Syntax in Vue.js</h3><pre><code>variable_name:value</code></pre><p>Vue.js follows the same TypeScript standard. So you use all your Angular variable types using the above syntax (a colon).</p><p>For creating singular variables, objects, arrays, and arrays of objects it's the same as in Angular.</p><p>Bing the variable into the UI using double curly braces - {{}}</p><pre><code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Name:{{name}}&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addition of 10 and 20 is {{a+b}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emp Name : {{emp.name}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emp Age : {{emp.age}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emp Gender : {{emp.gender}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>For two way data binding we use ngModel in Angular whereas in Vue.js, we use v-model.</p><h3 id="integration">Integration</h3><p>It is simple to integrate Angular with 3rd party elements and other JavaScript libraries.</p><p>Vue also makes it easy to integrate many popular front end libraries, even if a project is already underway.</p><h3 id="complexity-level">Complexity Level</h3><p>Angular is more complex than Vue, both in terms of design and its API. Building a complex app with Angular is more time-consuming compared to Vue.</p><p>Angular's documentation is also much more complicated. Developers need to spend a lot of time going through the docs to understand its core concepts. It's tough for someone new to Angular to pick it up and start building an application.</p><p>Vue is easier to manage, both at the design and API level. Anyone who knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can build a single-page application in less than a day using Vue.</p><h3 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h3><p>Angular offers official support for a range of systems without restrictions on the overall project structure. Because it's so flexible, developers hold it in high regard.</p><p>Even so, Angular is opinionated. Developers need to adhere to an overall project structure and follow certain design patterns.</p><p>Vue is flexible, but not quite as flexible as Angular.</p><h3 id="performance">Performance</h3><p>Angular doesn't let developers down in terms of performance. It's fast, even when there are a lot of watchers. Whenever the scale of the project changes, watchers need to re-evaluate the project all over again. Even so, Angular performs well on many benchmarks.</p><p>Vue is fast and performs similarly to Angular on the same benchmarks.</p><h3 id="typescript">Typescript</h3><p>One of the reasons the learning curve for Angular is steeper is because it uses TypeScript. While those proficient in JavaScript shouldn't have a problem picking up TypeScript, beginners might find it difficult.</p><p>You must learn TypeScript to work on Angular, as its learning resources and documentation are all based on TypeScript.</p><p>The benefit of TypeScript is that it provides static type checking for scaled applications. This means developers get type-safety throughout the application, which saves time overall and lowers chance of errors on a run-time basis.</p><p>While Vue has TypeScript support, it's not used much. That said, Vue might become an entirely TypeScript-based platform in time.</p><h2 id="which-is-the-best-for-front-end-development-angular-or-vue">Which is the best for front end development — Angular or Vue?</h2><p>Considering all the benefits and limitations, Angular is best when projects take advantage of its many functionalities and features. </p><p>On the other hand, Vue is better-suited for smaller development projects and applications where speed is important (which makes up for its fewer features).</p><p>Also, Angular has more community support compared to Vue. Still, the growing popularity of Vue has led to a boost in community support, as its growing number of stars on <a href="https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190">Github</a> demonstrate.</p><h2 id="so-which-is-the-best-overall-angular-or-vue">So which is the best overall, Angular or Vue?</h2><p>If you want to work with Angular, you need to know concepts such as MVC and TypeScript. But this is not the case for Vue.</p><p>Also, Vue delivers basic application templates and a higher range of custom functions, which makes it simpler to use than Angular.</p><p>Another factor to consider is architecture. Angular uses MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and MVC (Model-View-Controller) to develop sites and web-based applications. Vue, on the other hand, focuses on the ViewModel which is a bit more restrictive.</p><h3 id="what-about-scalability">What about scalability? </h3><p>Angular leads the contest in scalability. This is because Angular has a modular development structure, while Vue uses template-based syntax. And this template-based syntax trims down the overall reusability of code in large applications.</p><h3 id="what-about-loading-time">What about loading time?</h3><p>Angular apps are not as light as those built with Vue. But new Angular versions have features like Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and tree shaking, which trim down the application size quite a bit. </p><p>And since loading time depends a lot on application size, Vue mobile apps load more quickly.</p><h3 id="what-about-syntax">What about syntax?</h3><p>While working with both platforms, developers often find that Vue is simpler in terms of syntax. </p><p>Angular uses TypeScript (with injectors and decorators), so developers need to have a fundamental understanding of the language. They should also have experience with Object-oriented Programming System (OOPS) concepts.</p><p>Let's look at some code in Angular and Vue:</p><ol><li><strong>Angular</strong></li></ol><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello {{name}}&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><pre><code>Import {  Component  } from ‘@angular/core’ ;
@Component ({
selector:  ‘my – app’,
templateUrl:  ‘src/app/app.component.html’
})
export class AppComponent {
constructer() {}
name: string = ‘Angular 2’;
}</code></pre><p><strong>2. Vue</strong></p><pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;meta&gt;
&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hello world example&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/meta&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="hello-world-example"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;{{ hello world }}&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
new vue({
el: "#hello-world-example",
data()  {
return  {
msg: "Hello World!"
}
}
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
