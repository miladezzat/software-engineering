<p>Coding a project is a great way to improve your Python skills. But why stop at one project? Why not go for an even dozen?</p><p>We've released a beginner's Python course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build 12 different projects in Python.</p><p>Kylie Ying created this course. Kylie is a graduate student at MIT, a software engineer, and an experienced teacher.</p><p>Kylie will walk you through the implementation of 12 Python projects, in order from simplest to most complex. In each of these projects, you will learn about a new component of the Python programming language.</p><p>Here are the different projects you will build:</p><ul><li>Madlibs</li><li>Guess the Number (computer) </li><li>Guess the Number (user)</li><li>Rock Paper Scissors</li><li>Hangman</li><li>Tic-Tac-Toe</li><li>Tic-Tac-Toe AI</li><li>Binary Search </li><li>Minesweeper </li><li>Sudoku Solver </li><li>Photo Manipulation in Python </li><li>Markov Chain Text Composer </li></ul><p>It would help to have a bit of knowledge of Python before beginning this course. But even if you're brand new to Python, you should still be able to follow along.</p><p><strong>You can watch this course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ext9G7xspg">on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel</a> (3-hour watch).</strong></p>
