<p>Most websites have landing pages and someone needs to make all those landing pages.</p><p>We've released a 5-hour course on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you how to build a responsive website from scratch using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.</p><p>Jessica Chan created this course. She runs the popular Coder Coder YouTube channel and has created many software courses. In this course, Jessica explains why she does things a certain way, not just how to do things.</p><p>In the first part of this course you will learn how to set up the project and create the desktop navigation bar. Part two covers building the hamburger and overlay animation. You will get to see the whole process including writing code and troubleshooting problems. Then, in part three, you will learn how to create the off-canvas mobile menu and how to tweak the overlay.</p><p>In the next few parts, you will learn how to build the responsive hero with background image and build a 4-column responsive layout for the Features and Blog Articles sections using flexbox and CSS grid. Finally, you will learn how to use CSS grid template areas to build the footer of the landing page.</p><p>Watch the full course on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8">the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel</a> (5-hour watch).</p>
