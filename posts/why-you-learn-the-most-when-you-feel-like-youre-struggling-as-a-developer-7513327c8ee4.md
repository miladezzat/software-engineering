<p>The times when I have made the greatest leaps in my development skills have been when I struggled to learn something new and didn’t give up. This has not always been easy for me. I have come across a few ideas that have helped me push through my personal blocks.</p><p>Perhaps you can relate.</p><p>It’s all too easy to feel frustrated when you are faced with software engineering problems that are hard. I sometimes experience a feeling of wanting to give up. In situations like this I’ve observed my rational mind coming up with reasons why I should go spend time on something I’m more familiar with or complaining that the problem is beyond me.</p><p>I know I’m not alone.</p><p>I see people on Reddit talking about the challenges they’re having with their classes and I have had many conversations with other professional engineers who are facing doubts about their ability to grasp complicated concepts that their colleagues seem to “just get”.</p><p>Although it’s not easy, being able to persevere in the face of these challenges is so valuable.</p><p>Over the years I have developed a few mental strategies that have helped me get through these hard times.</p><p>Here are a few viewpoints that are helpful for me.</p><h4 id="1-a-person-becomes-a-better-developer-through-their-hard-work-and-effort-">1. A person becomes a better developer through their hard work and effort.</h4><p>Is it talent or hard work that makes a great developer?</p><p>What do you think? Are some people just born great developers or do people become great developers through effort?</p><p>I believe that it is impossible to know<em> </em>the true answer to this question so I have chosen to believe that a person <em>becomes</em> a good developer through their efforts.</p><p>It’s a more useful viewpoint. It means that if I am struggling to learn something, I <em>can</em> learn it if I work hard.</p><p>It also means that I have to accept that things won’t always be easy or fun. Hard work is required.</p><h4 id="2-when-you-try-to-do-something-for-the-first-time-it-might-be-hard-and-you-re-not-supposed-to-be-good-at-it-immediately">2. When you try to do something for the first time, it might be hard — and you’re not supposed to be good at it immediately</h4><p>As a programmer, I sometimes find myself feeling frustrated because I run into something I don’t understand and I feel like I <em>should</em> understand it.</p><p>There was the time when I joined a company that was using git and was surrounded by git experts. There was the time I finally had to face the fact that my SQL skills weren’t very good.</p><p>In each of these instances a part of me felt that I <em>should</em> be good at these skills. After all, wasn’t I a senior full-stack engineer with years of experience?</p><p>The fact was that although I was an engineer with a lot of experience, no amount of experience could change my reality — I was learning the details of these skills for the first time, and at first I wasn’t that good at either of them.</p><p>Although sometimes new things are easy, sometimes they are not. I have found that a useful viewpoint is that when I do something for the first time I am not <em>supposed</em> to be good at it.</p><p>It goes like this…</p><p>“I’ve never programmed in Java before — I’m not supposed to be good at it. That’s why I’m taking this class”</p><p>“I’ve never committed code to a git repo before — I’m not supposed to know how to do it. That’s why I’m asking my colleague for help”</p><p>This kind of thinking defuses that voice in my head that’s saying I’m no good or I’m going to fail. I very well may fail and I’m probably not good yet. I’m not supposed to be good — that’s why I’m giving it a try — to get better.</p><h4 id="3-working-on-code-is-not-always-supposed-to-be-fun-and-even-though-a-task-is-not-fun-it-can-still-be-done">3. Working on code is not always supposed to be fun, and even though a task is not fun, it can still be done</h4><p>Sometimes I run into tasks in software development that are not fun.</p><p>Some piece of data processing code in my Spark cluster is causing nodes to randomly fail, or some library that should work will not work no matter what I do.</p><p>These moments are not fun, and sometimes I honestly would rather do anything other than spend my time trying to figure out what’s going on.</p><p>The thing is, I know that coding is not always <em>supposed</em> to be fun and sometimes I just have to roll up my sleeves and ‘do the work’.</p><p>Even though times like this can be hard, I’ve found that they usually have a silver lining — it turns out that the hard stuff is where we learn the most.</p><h4 id="4-you-learn-the-most-when-you-face-the-greatest-challenges-and-failure-at-times-like-this-is-normal">4. You learn the most when you face the greatest challenges — and failure at times like this is normal</h4><p>When I challenge myself by trying to do something that is too hard for me, I find that those are the moments when I truly learn.</p><p>For me, dozens of examples stand out.</p><p>There was the first time that I picked up a programming book — I struggled until suddenly I had learned to code.</p><p>There was the time I was trying to architect larger applications. I struggled until I discovered architectural frameworks and learned about design patterns — at which point we threw away months of work on previous code, started over, and rebuilt our app in a few short weeks using the new design patterns.</p><p>There was the time that I finally buckled down and really learned SQL. After that I had the skills to work with my company’s data science team.</p><p>There was the time I tried to architect our company’s data processing infrastructure using web-app technologies. I struggled until I learned about data lakes, ETL pipelines, and distributed computing solutions.</p><p>The list goes on.</p><p>Each of these experiences had its painful moments. I went down a lot of dead end alleys and threw out a lot of code. I tried a lot of things and I failed, a lot.</p><p>But that pressure taught me new skills and made me a better developer. Had it not been for that pressure I never would have learned my lessons.</p><p>These days I choose to believe that when I am feeling stressed out, struggling, and a bit nervous it is a good thing. I am <em>struggling</em> so I am <em>learning.</em></p><p>And…</p><p>I have learned to welcome those nervous feelings. They’re not comfortable but I think the learning is worth it.</p><h4 id="the-mind-is-a-powerful-tool">The mind is a powerful tool</h4><p>You can choose what you believe and your beliefs can give you the grit to push through the challenges you will inevitably face on your path to becoming a better developer.</p><p>I hope these mental frameworks (or some of your own) are useful for helping you get past your own struggles.</p><p>Don’t give up. Keep going.</p><p>When you don’t understand something, keep working hard and keep trying to understand it. You will be surprised what you are capable of if you just try.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my article.</p><p>If you found this article helpful, let me know ???.</p><p>If you’d like to read more of my work you can <a href="https://twitter.com/wschlender" rel="noopener">follow me on twitter</a> or <a href="https://wildnotion.com/signup" rel="noopener">subscribe to my email list</a> where I email from time to time with the latest insights from my work.</p>
