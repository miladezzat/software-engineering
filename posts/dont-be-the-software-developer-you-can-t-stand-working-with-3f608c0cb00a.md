n = number of people
t1 = time late to meeting
t2 = time wasted bring the developer up to speed</code></pre><p>Example scenario:</p><p>A team has six developers. One developer shows up 10 minutes late. The team takes five minutes to bring them up to speed. The total time loss would be 6x(10+5) minutes. That would be a total of 90 minutes wasted.</p><p>Coming late to meetings disrupts the flow of the meeting. Other colleagues might be having a productive discussion when the late developer interrupts.</p><p>Punctuality is an attitude.</p><p>Having the attitude of punctuality saves everyone’s time and nerves. Besides, it also gives the positive impression of reliability. Showing up at every meeting on time means we give a damn. It means the chances are higher that we give a damn about delivering our work on time, too.</p><h3 id="disregarding-non-code-aspects-of-work">Disregarding non-code aspects of work</h3><p>There are times that I hear a developer say “The UI I built is ugly because I am not a designer”. This makes me want to get into Hulk mode and flip my standing desk.</p><p>Coding is just one of the responsibilities of the developer.</p><p>To be good at software development means that we adopt a holistic approach to our work. We should also consider aspects like user experience, architecture, and business strategy.</p><p>To think that software development is merely about coding is like saying you can drive because you know how to step on the gas pedal.</p><p>Ignoring the big picture will make the software hard to use, expensive to maintain, and inconsistent with the other components.</p><p>It is our responsibility as software developers to educate ourselves in all aspects. Granted, we cannot be experts in all fields. The important thing is to have adequate awareness. We can always request the help of experts when needed.</p><p>Having a holistic view of things will also allow us to understand other roles better.</p><p>When I engage in discussions with designers, I make it a habit to learn how design decisions are made. I do it by asking questions. This improves my basic understanding of design principles.</p><p>Learning to see the bigger picture better is a continuous process. A process driven by curiosity and the commitment to produce good work.</p><h3 id="talking-about-excuses-instead-of-solutions">Talking about excuses instead of solutions</h3><p>Everyone has a bad patch at some point. Sometimes, it takes longer to produce the results we want. This is totally fine. It is not fine when a developer constantly produces excuses instead of results.</p><p>Typical excuses include time constraints, inadequate knowledge, or task difficulty.</p><p>Producing excuses on a constant basis has zero positive effect on the team. It wastes time at best. In the worst case, it lowers the bar of excellence in the team.</p><p>Instead of excuses, I prefer to hear about the specific steps the developer has already taken.</p><p>This has many benefits:</p><ul><li>Gives the team a better chance to offer help or solutions</li><li>Allows the team to learn from the problem</li><li>Provides a better picture of the task progress</li></ul><p>Talking about solutions is what we do. After all, we are engineers. Engineers solve problems.</p><h3 id="philosophizing-about-the-unknown-instead-of-figuring-out-the-problem">Philosophizing about the unknown instead of figuring out the problem</h3><p>On many occasions, colleagues argue technical topics based on their opinions. Opinions that are not backed by any facts.</p><p>Such lengthy discussions can be ended by finding out the facts instead of arguing about it.</p><blockquote>“Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.”<br><br>— Isaac Newton, one smart dude</blockquote><p>In software development, we deal with both technical and non-technical issues.</p><p>With the technical issues, we have the luxury that things are usually black and white. Any disputes can be resolved by trying out code in a sandbox or running a piece of software to check what it does.</p><p>Non-technical issues are resolved by reading the documentation, asking subject experts, or googling.</p><h3 id="complaining-and-having-an-aura-of-negativity">Complaining and having an aura of negativity</h3><p>Most developers I have worked with are positive and enthusiastic people. Maybe that is why working with negative developers bugs me so much.</p><p>Negativity is infectious. If someone complains, it focuses the attention on the negative side of things. Others will be inclined to adopt the same attitude.</p><blockquote>“Negativity is the enemy of creativity.”<br><br>— David Lynch, film director</blockquote><p>Of course, it is not all roses in software development. There are hard times. We do sometimes have to work with legacy code from the dark ages or with tools that have the performance of a sloth.</p><p>It is better to ask ourselves what we can control instead of reiterating what we cannot change.</p><p>We can allocate resources for code refactoring or write documentation. We can find out if we can tweak the memory settings of slow tools to speed them up.</p><h3 id="rambling-on-in-meetings">Rambling on in meetings</h3><p>In meetings, I see eyes rolling back when “that developer” rambles on and on.</p><p>Like any other profession, verbal communication is one of the key soft skills we have to learn.</p><p>When communicating, getting straight to the point works wonders. Colleagues will understand us and the situation better.</p><p>One communication pet peeve of mine is when a developer talks to non-coders using jargon. Designers sometimes pretend to nod when a developer rambles on about JavaScript intricacies. Anything to get them to stop talking.</p><p>Knowing whom you are talking with and speaking in their lingo is common sense. Sometimes, common sense is not common.</p><h3 id="stealing-credit-for-yourself">Stealing credit for yourself</h3><p>Once in a while, I will see a developer stealing credit for the work produced by a team effort. They would write an email to management advertising the feature or talk about a task as if they had done it alone.</p><p>More often than not, this is communicated in a sneaky non-straightforward way. The credit taking statements are cleverly implied.</p><p>Such strategies might produce short-term visibility for that individual.</p><p>In the long run, such developers will be alienated. This is done either by choice or subconsciously. Other team members will evolve their communication to highlight their contributions better.</p><p>It would make much more sense to give credit to others when it is due. No need to overdo it. But I’m saying give due credit.</p><p>There are many ways to give credit. We can mention the colleague’s contributions during Daily Scrum. We can thank the colleague via email and copy their manager.</p><p>There are myriad benefits of giving due credit:</p><ul><li>You feel good because you are honest.</li><li>The contributing colleague feels acknowledged.</li><li>Allows the manager to have a more accurate impression of the colleague.</li><li>The team has a better picture of skill sets of individuals.</li></ul><p>Thus, let us be aware of when to give or take credit.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>The path to becoming a better developer is a never-ending process. Sometimes, it makes sense to take a stop on that path to reflect on how we do things. The art of professional self-reflection helps us correct our course. Becoming better at our trade increases our level of contentment with what we produce.</p><p><strong>Let us be the software developer we love to work with.</strong></p>
