<p><em>This post was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/githunt-trending-github-projects-in-your-chrome-new-tab-screen-d57168922918">Medium</a></em><br><br>GitHub is widely known as one of the most famous version control repositories. In it, you can find almost countless public projects in many programming languages. It makes it easy for you to collaborate with your team members and fellow developers around the globe. Together, you can learn from and also contribute to these projects.</p><h4 id="finding-and-working-on-trending-projects">Finding and working on Trending Projects</h4><p>Among many other things, GitHub displays <strong>Trending Projects</strong>. This makes it easier for you to know which projects have received the most attention. You can find projects that have received a lot of stars from fellow developers in the recent past.</p><p>The process of finding new trending projects has gotten even easier: there’s now a Chrome extension, called GitHunt, dedicated to increasing your exposure to open source projects.</p><p>GitHunt can be installed as a Chrome extension in your browser, giving you the ability to see top trending projects on GitHub right in your <strong>new tabs</strong>. You can see trending projects on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.</p><p>You can choose to display trending projects in only one language or in all languages. But there is currently no option to choose more than one language without including all of them.</p><p>Aside from the project title and the number of stars, you can also view a short project description (if it has already been added) and the number of issues opened. You can also visit that project by simply clicking on the project displayed in the new tab.</p><h3 id="why-should-you-install-this-extension">Why should you install this extension?</h3><p>GitHub has been <a href="http://code.dblock.org/2011/07/14/github-is-your-new-resume.html" rel="noopener">called the new resume</a> for software developers. It is a great way to promote your knowledge, skills, expertise, and style of coding to potential recruiters.</p><p>As a result, many developers publish some of their best work on GitHub. This allows other developers to learn from it, contribute to it, and publish their own innovations.</p><p>Even so, it is sometimes difficult to stumble upon the very best projects. You might not be in the habit of checking GitHub directly just to see the trending projects. But if you have them right in your new tabs in Chrome, you’ll increase your chances of discovering new and interesting projects that can help you.</p><p>Large companies like <a href="https://readwrite.com/2013/10/17/is-facebook-the-worlds-largest-open-source-company/" rel="noopener">Facebook, Google,</a> and <a href="https://opensource.org/node/901" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> benefit so much from open source projects. Let this convince you to use this extension in your browser even more.</p><p>You might find a simple project in your new tabs that has already solved the problem that has been bothering you for a long time. Maybe you planned to search Google for a plausible solution, but that solution might be right there.</p><p>These projects can also inspire you with new knowledge, ideas, and patterns to help you build your next trending open source projects.</p><p>GitHunt is also an open-source project that you can <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/githunt" rel="noopener">find on GitHub</a>. If you have any ideas about how to improve it, the <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse" rel="noopener">author</a> has already called for your contributions. I have already made a few <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/githunt/pull/15" rel="noopener">minor typo fixes</a> and invite you to continue improving this great project.</p><p>You can read more and see the source code of this extension by visiting its <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/githunt" rel="noopener">GitHub page</a>. You can download and install it via <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/githunt/khpcnaokfebphakjgdgpinmglconplhp" rel="noopener">Chrome Webstore</a>.</p><p><em>This post was originally published on <a href="https://medium.com/better-programming/githunt-trending-github-projects-in-your-chrome-new-tab-screen-d57168922918">Medium</a></em></p>
