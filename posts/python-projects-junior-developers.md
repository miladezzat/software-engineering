</code></pre><h3 id="what-s-my-acronym">What's my acronym?</h3><p>Ask the user to enter the full meaning of an organization or concept and you'll provide the acronym to the user. For example:</p><ul><li>Input -&gt; <code>As Soon As Possible</code>. Output -&gt; <code>ASAP</code>.</li><li>Input -&gt; <code>World Health Organization</code>. Output -&gt; <code>WHO</code>.</li><li>Input -&gt; <code>Absent Without Leave</code>. Output -&gt; <code>AWOL</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="rock-paper-scissors">Rock, Paper, Scissors</h3><p>This is a popular game played between two people. Each player gets to form one of three shapes using their hand:</p><ul><li><code>rock</code> (a closed fist)</li><li><code>paper</code> (a flat hand)</li><li><code>scissors</code> (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V)</li></ul><p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wfxO_juzYM">youtube tutorial on coding up rock-paper-scissors in Python</a>.</p><h3 id="guess-the-number">Guess the number</h3><p>You ask a user to guess a number between 1 and 50.</p><p>If they guess outside that range, you prompt with an error encouraging them to choose a number within the proper range.</p><p>Whenever they guess the wrong number you ask if they want to keep playing or if they'd like to quit.</p><p>Finally, when the user eventually guesses the right number you congratulate them and show the number of attempts they had.</p><p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sWTNMi4XpE">youtube tutorial on coding up a number guessing game in Python</a>.</p><h3 id="is-a-palindrome">Is a palindrome</h3><p>Ask the user to give you five words. Then check if any of the five words is a palindrome.</p><p>A palindrome is a word that remains the same whether it's read forward or backward.</p><p>Example:</p><ul><li><code>madam</code> is a palindrome.</li><li>so is <code>malayalam</code>.</li><li>But not <code>geeks</code>.</li></ul><p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/kuzmicheff/palindrome/blob/master/palindrome.py">some example code</a> from Github.</p><h3 id="calculate-the-tip">Calculate the tip</h3><p>Your goal is to find out exactly how much tip you should give after receiving a service. In this scenario, ask for the total bill. Then display the tip for 18%, 20% and 25%. </p><p>Example:</p><ul><li>Prompt: <code>what's the total bill for today, please?</code></li><li>Input: <code>$55.87</code></li><li>Output: <code>18% tip is $10.06, which brings your total to $65.93</code></li></ul><p>Remember you want to be nice, so don't forget to round up. To push this more, ask for the number of people involved, then evenly split the tip and total cost among them. </p><p>To go even a step further, split unevenly (for example, one person pays 70% of the bill while the other pays 30%)</p><h3 id="email-slicer">Email slicer</h3><p>Collect an email address from the user and then find out if the user has a custom domain name or a popular domain name. For example:</p><ul><li>Input: <code>mary.jane@gmail.com</code></li><li>Output: <code>Hey Mary, I see your email is registered with Google. That's cool!</code>.</li><li>Input: <code>peter.pan@myfantasy.com</code></li><li>Output: <code>Hey Peter, looks like you've got your own custom setup at MyFantasy. Impressive!</code>.</li></ul><p>This is a convenient python project that has a lot of use in the future. The program helps get you the username and domain name from an email address. </p><p>If you want to push this further, you can customize the application and send a message to the host with this information. </p><p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVpcbF3Q5wE&amp;feature=emb_title">Youtube tutorial</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/TomColBee/4cf607f2e5b0e7b703b4d343d6a6c4e8">example code</a> from Github.</p><h3 id="lyrics-generator">Lyrics generator</h3><p>Ask a user to choose from a list of 10 songs. When the user does, you print out the lyrics to the song they selected.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>Welcome, please select a select a song from this top 10 songs:
1. Baby by Bieber
2. Hotline Bling by Drake
3. Flawless by Beyonce
4. Fall by Eminem...
</code></pre><pre><code>You chose Flawless by Beyonce. Here you go:
------- Flawless by Beyonce ------------
I'm out that H, town coming coming down
I'm coming down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, Town, Town, I'm coming down, coming down
Drippin' candy on the ground...
Press * to choose again.
</code></pre><p>To push it further, have at least 3 songs by the same artist. </p><p>Next, ask the user to put the name of the artist so you can show them only options by that artist. Then the user can select a specific song from that list.</p><h2 id="closing-out"><strong>Closing out</strong></h2><p>Working on these projects, you might hit a road block and get completely discouraged. It's okay. You'll get through.</p><p>Remember, take a break then come back to it later. You can also read <a href="https://lifetechpsych.com/developer-stories">these stories of developers from all kinds of backgrounds who made it</a> to motivate yourself to keep going.</p><p>Software development is a challenging field. But with lots of rewards.</p><p>If so many others have done, you too can do it.</p><h2 id="thanks-for-reading"><strong>Thanks for reading</strong></h2><p>If you enjoyed this, there's more.</p><ul><li><a href="https://lifetechpsych.ck.page/">Join my email community</a>: I share techniques for new coders and junior developers to grow faster and double their confidence.
