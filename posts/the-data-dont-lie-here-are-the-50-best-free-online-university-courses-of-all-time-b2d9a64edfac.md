<p>When I launched Class Central back in November 2011, there were around 18 or so free online courses, and almost all of them were from Stanford.</p><p>Now there are close to 6,000 free online university courses from 600+ universities around the world. This can be daunting to the millions of learners around the world who have never done an online course before.</p><p>In providing a small but well-reviewed list of courses, our hope is that new learners will not be overwhelmed by the huge variety of options out there. Reviews will help new learners figure out if a course is right for them, so they can have a great first experience.</p><h4 id="our-methodology-for-creating-this-list">Our methodology for creating this list</h4><p>Class Central has thousands of reviews written by our users, and we were able to sort these courses by the Bayesian average of their ratings.</p><p>Then we removed all the courses with less than ten reviews (the low threshold helps smaller providers to compete on quality) and courses for which we had doubts whether they would be offered again.</p><p>If a course has multiple parts, we only included the first part in the Top 50.</p><h4 id="the-best-courses">The best courses</h4><p>There are a lot of usual suspects in the Top 50. Think of courses like <em>Learning How To Learn</em>, Harvard’s <em>CS50x</em>, <em>ModPo</em>, and Class Central’s <a href="https://www.class-central.com/report/best-free-online-courses-2015/" rel="noopener">best online course of 2015</a> — <em>A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment.</em> Courses from the founders/CEOs of edX, Coursera, and Udacity are also present.</p><p>But there are also a few surprises in the Top 50, such as a couple of language learning courses — FutureLearn’s <em>Introduction to Dutch</em> from the University of Groningen and <em>Tsinghua Chinese: Start Talking with 1.3 Billion People</em> on edX, for example.</p><p>Here is a quick summary of the Top 50 list:</p><ol><li>Coursera is the top provider with 26 courses in the Top 50, and edX is second with 10 courses.</li><li>Stanford tops the list of universities present in the Top 50 with five of their courses making it in, and MIT comes in second with three courses.</li><li>This list includes courses from 34 universities, of which 21 universities are in the US.</li><li>UIUC’s Aric Rindfleisch has two courses in the top 50.</li></ol><p>If you want to see all courses sorted by their rating, visit the <a href="https://www.class-central.com/collection/top-free-online-courses" rel="noopener">Top 50 collection page</a>. Alternatively, we have organized the courses into four major categories below.</p><h4 id="technology-20-courses-">Technology (20 courses)</h4><p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/mooc/408/coursera-an-introduction-to-interactive-programming-in-python-part-1" rel="noopener"><strong>An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python (Part 1)</strong></a><br><em>Rice University, via Coursera</em><br>This course is designed to help students with very little or no computing background learn the basics of building simple interactive applications.<br> ★★★★★ (<a href="https://www.class-central.com/mooc/408/coursera-an-introduction-to-interactive-programming-in-python-part-1#course-all-reviews" rel="noopener">2813 ratings</a>)</p><p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/mooc/319/udacity-artificial-intelligence-for-robotics" rel="noopener"><strong>Artificial Intelligence for Robotics</strong></a><br><em>Stanford University, via Udacity</em><br>Learn how to program all the major systems of a robotic car from the leader of Google and Stanford’s autonomous driving teams.
