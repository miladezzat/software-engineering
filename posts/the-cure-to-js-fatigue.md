<h2 id="newtoolsworryme">New Tools Worry Me</h2>
<p>When JavaScript's shiny tool of the day comes out, I sometimes overreact.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/learn-or-lose-job-1.jpeg" alt="learn-or-lose-job-1"></p>
<p>And after 15 minutes of my imagination running wild, the urge to explore it becomes unbearable.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what tool, it's all the same story.</p>
<ul>
<li>I must learn this technology!</li>
<li>I need every advantage in this competitive job market!</li>
<li>I have to stay relevant, right?!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/i-must-learn-it.jpeg" alt="i-must-learn-it"></p>
<p>Well yes, but no.</p>
<h2 id="myseniorsneverworry">My Seniors Never Worry</h2>
<p>Sometimes I'll share this sentiment with senior developers in the office, and get a standard reaction from them.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/another-tool-so-what-lol.jpeg" alt="another-tool-so-what-lol"></p>
<p>After enough encounters like this, I began thinking...</p>
<h2 id="whythedifference">Why the Difference?</h2>
<p>Why do I anxiously pounce on today's top tool, seemingly doomed to repeat this forever...</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/maybe-i-can-learn-it-before-the-next-one.jpg" alt="maybe-i-can-learn-it-before-the-next-one"></p>
<p>While my seniors calmly let the JavaScript storms pass, picking tools up as needed?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/seniors-are-quick-learners.jpeg" alt="seniors-are-quick-learners"></p>
<p>It's because they see common threads among these tools. To them, even after all these years, the landscape isn't so different.</p>
<p>Where do these common threads come from? The fundamentals.</p>
<h2 id="itsallinthefundamentals">It's All in the Fundamentals</h2>
<p>The best developers I've met aren't phased by JavaScript's light-speed evolution. They aren't exhausted from JavaScript fatigue because they dropped out of that race.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/cant-get-fatigued-if.jpeg" alt="cant-get-fatigued-if"></p>
<p>Instead of learning frameworks to <em>boost</em> their careers, they focused on the fundamentals and <em>skyrocketed</em> their careers.</p>
<p>Your favorite framework can plummet one day, and you'll eventually have to pick up another one.</p>
<p>But the fundamentals are evergreen. They date back to computer science resources from decades ago. No matter the age, these principles still make up the foundation of computing.</p>
<p>This tweet I stumbled across sums it up perfectly.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reading computing papers from the 50s, 60s, and 70s is like digging in an archeological site and finding a sonic screwdriver.</p>— -=fogus=- (@fogus) <a href="https://twitter.com/fogus/status/1135987780557950978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2019</a></blockquote>
<p>We're all just building on the groundwork established a long, long time ago.</p>
<h2 id="whatarethefundamentals">What Are the Fundamentals?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/yoda-fundamentals.jpeg" alt="yoda-fundamentals"></p>
<p>This isn't a comprehensive list, but whoever tackles it will become an amazing programmer. It'll keep you busy for years to come.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning multiple programming languages</li>
<li>Algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Anti-patterns</li>
<li>Application architecture</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="learningmultipleprogramminglanguages">Learning multiple programming languages</h3>
<p>Languages solve problems in different ways. None of them are perfect, that's why we have so many.</p>
<p>If you're doing JavaScript, get uncomfortable by learning C#. If you really want to push yourself, try Haskell.</p>
<p>Compare the solutions each language offers. The more you tackle, the faster you'll learn new things because they all draw from each other.</p>
<h3 id="algorithmsanddatastructures">Algorithms and data structures</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/lets-skip-algorithms.jpeg" alt="lets-skip-algorithms"></p>
<p>People love hating on this topic.</p>
<ul>
<li>"When will I need this?"</li>
<li>"This is useless."</li>
<li>"CS degrees are a waste of money."</li>
</ul>
<p>You may never need them, but that doesn't make learning algorithms and data structures a bad investment.</p>
<p>As an IT major, part of me wishes I could go back and take some CS courses, especially algorithms and data structures. The power I felt after learning them was amazing. It's like putting on glasses you never knew you had!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/i-know-binary-trees.jpeg" alt="i-know-binary-trees"></p>
<p>The biggest benefit, in my opinion, is improved problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>The ability to calm down, walk to a notebook/whiteboard, and work towards a solution is an asset that'll save you countless hours of frustrated hacking.</p>
<p>Before that I'd gallop into the editor like a classic coding cowboy, code myself into a corner, and <em>then</em> try to figure out a good solution.</p>
<h3 id="designpatterns">Design patterns</h3>
<p>From Addy Osmani's brilliant book- Learning JavaScript Design Patterns</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A pattern is a reusable solution that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in software design...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These battle-tested solutions have stood the test of time. Learning them helps you write code that is more familiar and maintainable to other developers.</p>
<p>You may not have realized it, but modern JavaScript stacks leverage popular design patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundlers like Webpack and Parcel let you use the <strong>Module pattern</strong> to separate JavaScript into organized files.</li>
<li>Libraries like RxJS and Redux use the <strong>Observer pattern</strong> to send and receive "notifications".</li>
<li>Libraries like React-Redux and Recompose let you enhance your components, otherwise known as the <strong>Decorator pattern</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="antipatterns">Anti-patterns</h3>
<p>If design patterns are so <em>good</em> that we should share them, anti-patterns are so <em>bad</em> that we should warn against them.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/anti-vs-design-patterns.jpeg" alt="anti-vs-design-patterns"></p>
<p>Pulling from Addy Osmani's book again, here are some common JavaScript anti-patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining many global variables</li>
<li>Modifying the <code>Object</code> class prototype</li>
<li>Using <code>document.write</code></li>
<li>Using inline JavaScript. For example...</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- Inline JavaScript anti-pattern --&gt;
&lt;a href="#" onclick="alert('Hi')"&gt;Click Me&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="applicationarchitecture">Application architecture</h3>
<p>Here's where the acronyms go crazy</p>
<ul>
<li>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</li>
<li>MVP (Model-View-Presenter)</li>
<li>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</li>
<li>MVU (Model-View-Update)</li>
<li>MVI (Model-View-Intent)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of MVC.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/mvc-diagram.png" alt="mvc-diagram"></p>
<p>Their common core is <strong>separate your concerns</strong>. Most applications have a model (data) and view (UI), and it's important they not speak to each other. That's where the controller sits and it mediates their back and forth communication.</p>
<h2 id="summarytoolsareamazing">Summary - Tools Are Amazing ❤️</h2>
<p>A true marvel of software engineering. Increase your productivity by learning and enjoying them!</p>
<p>But don't forget your fundamentals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning multiple programming languages</li>
<li>Algorithms and data structures</li>
<li>Design patterns</li>
<li>Anti-patterns</li>
<li>Application architecture</li>
</ul>
<p>I leave you with one last tweet.</p>
