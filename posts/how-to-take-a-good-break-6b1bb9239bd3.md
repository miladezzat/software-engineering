<p>When I wrote about my <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/becoming-more-productive-while-working-less/" rel="noopener">productive routine</a> in a previous article, I said I’d work for 1.5 hours and take a break for 30 minutes. And I’d repeat this sequence four times a day.</p><p>In my experiments, I reduced my work hours to 4.5 hours (3 x 1.5-hour slots) and managed to get 40% more work done.</p><p>The key to this routine isn’t simply sitting at my desk for 1.5 hours each sprint.</p><p><strong>The key is a 30-minute break.</strong></p><p>If I don’t rest properly, I’ll waste the next 1.5 hours of work because I’m not focused. When I’m not focused, I can’t get work done.</p><p>So today, I want to share how I take a proper break.</p><h3 id="how-not-to-take-a-break">How NOT to take a break</h3><p>Here are some common ways people take breaks:</p><ol><li>Go for a walk</li><li>Take a shower</li><li>Power nap</li><li>Chat with friends</li><li>Look at Social Media</li><li>Surf internet</li><li>Watch TV</li><li>Eat food</li><li>Stare into space</li></ol><p>There’s way more than this list. <strong>You can find hundreds of tips about how to relax to become more productive</strong> online. A simple search gives you results like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/50-ways-to-relax-without-spending-a-dime-1788301034" rel="noopener">this</a>, <a href="https://socialtriggers.com/why-you-need-to-take-more-breaks-and-how-to-do-it/" rel="noopener">this</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40475204/youre-taking-breaks-the-wrong-way-heres-how-to-fix-that" rel="noopener">this</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an opinion on how often you should take breaks and what to do during your breaks. But they say different things.</p><p>Which is true?</p><p>I’ve tried many ideas out there on the internet. Here are some ways I found useful:</p><ol><li>Sleep</li><li>Staring into space with a cup of tea</li><li>Meditate</li><li>Listening to music that recharges me</li><li>Doing 10 pushups</li></ol><p><strong>But these methods don’t work for me.</strong> Even if they did, they would only work for <em>a day</em> or <em>two</em>.</p><p>For example, I can go for a walk on Monday. That’ll be an effective break. But on Tuesday, the walk wouldn’t work. I get stressed out on the walk.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Sometimes I can take a power nap. But on some days, I can’t sleep even if I desperately want to.</p><p>Why?</p><p>What I realized was: <strong>It’s useless following what other people say about taking breaks.</strong> You can’t pick “one thing” on the list and expect it to work forever.</p><h3 id="an-effective-break">An effective break</h3><p><strong>We use different energies for different things we do.</strong> Generally, we can say that humans have three basic bodies. <em>When you use a body, you use up its corresponding fuel tank</em>.</p><ol><li>The physical body</li><li>The emotional body</li><li>The intellectual body.</li></ol><p>When you take a break, you need to <strong>stop consuming the same type of energy you were consuming</strong>. Here’s an example:</p><p>Let’s say you go for a run. When you run, you expend physical energy. Your legs get tired. You pant like crazy. When you want to rest, you stop running and walk instead.</p><p>When you walk, you give your physical body a chance to recuperate.</p><p>See how this works?</p><p>If you code, you won’t get tired physically because typing into a keyboard doesn’t take a lot of physical energy. But you still get tired because you use your brain.</p><p>When you use your brain, you deplete the intellectual body’s fuel tank. If you want to recover your mental energy, you need to rest your mind.</p><p>And <strong>sometimes you expend more than one type of energy.</strong> You need to recover them all when you take a break.</p><p>For example, when I write articles, I consume <em>both emotional and mental energies</em>. Mental energies because I need to think about what I want to convey. Emotional energy because I need to put myself in your shoes. I also need to overcome my fears and doubts when I write.</p><p>So when I rest, <em>I need to recover both mental and emotional energies at the same time</em>. I can’t, for example, chat with people to recover my energy. Chatting with (most) people zaps both mental and emotional energy (for me).</p><p>It’s not rocket science.</p><p><strong>This is the reason why you can’t pick “one thing”</strong> and expect to recharge yourself every time. This is also why you shouldn’t listen to anyone else’s opinions on taking a break.</p><p><strong>Your body knows best.</strong> When you expend different types of energy (and in different quantities), you need to rest differently.</p><h3 id="an-effective-way-to-take-a-break">An effective way to take a break</h3><p>I found a way that works every time: <strong>Listen to your body and do exactly what it tells you</strong>.</p><p>Sometimes, it means walking farther out to buy bubble tea ? (even though it’s unhealthy).</p><p>Sometimes, it means bitching about the problem ? to a friend.</p><p>Sometimes, it means ditching work for the rest of today ?.</p><p>Sometimes, it means taking a walk ? in the park ?.</p><p>Sometimes, it means working on another project ?️.</p><p>Sometimes, it means learning something else ?.</p><p>Sometimes, it means chatting with my wife ?‍♀️.</p><p>Sometimes, it means watching a movie ?.</p><p>Sometimes, it means sleeping ?.</p><p>The point is, what you think you need isn’t always what you need. <strong>Pay attention to your body. It tells you what it needs.</strong></p><p>Sometimes, it’s okay to indulge just a little bit.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3><p>The best way to recharge is to listen to what your body wants. Have fun, relax, enjoy, have a good break, and get back to work.</p><p>Thanks for reading. Did this article help you in any way?
