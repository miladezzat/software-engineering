<p><em>Update July 2, 2020: <a href="/news/python-curriculum-is-live/">the 4 new Python certifications are now live</a>.</em></p><p>We've been working hard on Version 7.0 of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Here's what we're building.</p><p>Some of these improvements - including 4 new Python certifications - will go live in early 2020.</p><p>Note: if you're already going through the current version of the curriculum, keep going. As you'll see, there's no reason to stop.</p><h3 id="the-version-7-0-curriculum-">The Version 7.0 curriculum...</h3><p>Will take a person with very basic computer knowledge...</p><p>Build that person up through 3,000 hours of coursework...</p><p>Ramp up their programming skills...</p><p>Solidify their software engineering fundamentals...</p><p>And they will emerge on the other side as a well-rounded developer, ready for most entry-level developer jobs.</p><p>As always, there are no electives. There is no guesswork. You can just power through the curriculum from start to finish.</p><p>And along the way, you'll learn the tools and concepts used by modern software development teams.</p><p>With Version 7.0, you'll still learn Front End Web Development skills and Back End API design. </p><p>And now you'll also learn Python and its powerful suite of Data Science and Machine Learning tools.</p><h2 id="improvement-1-we-re-adding-4-new-data-focused-certifications-">Improvement #1: We're adding 4 new data-focused certifications.</h2><p>In addition to the 6 certifications we've had since 2017, we're adding 4 new certifications, all using Python:</p><ul><li>Scientific Computing</li><li>Data Analysis</li><li>Information Security</li><li>Machine Learning</li></ul><p>You'll use libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to build a wide variety of projects.</p><h2 id="improvement-2-instead-of-individual-lessons-everything-will-be-a-project-">Improvement #2: Instead of individual lessons, everything will be a project.</h2><p>Our current curriculum has blocks of individual lessons. These can feel disconnected from one another - and even a bit like "interactive documentation."</p><p>This approach has been effective enough to help 40,000 people get their first developer job. But building projects is a lot more fun. And learning should be fun. ?</p><p>So with Version 7.0, we're replacing these optional lessons with our all-new Practice Projects.</p><p>For each of these Practice Projects, you'll build up a codebase - one passing test after another.</p><p>Until - hundreds of passing tests later - you have a fully functional project.</p><p>For example, instead of learning JavaScript through a series of 200 discreet lessons, you'll learn JavaScript by building a fully playable role playing game.</p><p>We will build in a lot more repetition to help you strengthen your "muscle memory" for coding.</p><h2 id="improvement-3-we-re-adding-crash-courses-on-git-linux-and-sql-">Improvement #3: We're adding Crash Courses on Git, Linux, and SQL.</h2><p>Past versions of the freeCodeCamp curriculum taught Git, Linux, and SQL.</p><p>But we wanted to make the curriculum fully interactive. No articles. No videos. Just coding from start to finish.</p><p>So we made our curriculum run completely client-side. You could just jam through freeCodeCamp in your browser and ride a zero millisecond feedback loop.</p><p>Conventional wisdom at the time was that teaching Git, Linux, or SQL would require a file system. And this would require servers. And servers would introduce a lot of latency.</p><p>So we removed these parts from our curriculum and basically said: "go learn these from our YouTube channel or from other resources."</p><p>Well today, I'm thrilled to announce that we're working on some interactive crash courses for these three tools.</p><p>These will not be certifications. They will be stand-alone tutorials. And you'll be able to do them whenever you want. No other parts of the curriculum will depend upon these skills.</p><p>Since we're teaching these in your browser, we can only approximate a full server environment. But we're confident we can still teach you a lot of the core concepts interactively.</p><h1 id="here-s-the-full-version-7-0-curriculum-all-111-projects-">Here's the full Version 7.0 curriculum. All 111 projects.</h1><p>By the end of 2020, freeCodeCamp's curriculum will look something like this:</p><h3 id="-html-css-responsive-web-design-16-projects-">[HTML+CSS] Responsive Web Design (16 projects)</h3><p>?️ Practice Projects:️</p><ul><li>Learn Basic HTML by Building a Cat Photo App</li><li>Learn Basic CSS by Building a Blog</li><li>Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Picasso Painting</li><li>Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting</li><li>Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline</li><li>Learn CSS Animations by Building a Ferris Wheel</li><li>Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label</li><li>Learn Accessibility by Building a User Feedback Survey</li><li>Learn Responsive Web Design by Building a Piano</li><li>Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery</li><li>Learn CSS Grid by Building a Magazine</li></ul><p>?

None of these are breaking changes. The curriculum will remain fully backward compatible. </p><p><strong>If you've earned a certification in the past, you'll keep it. Nobody will have to re-do projects.</strong></p><p><strong>Stage 1</strong>: Publish Python Certification Projects</p><p><strong>Stage 2</strong>: Update Our User Interface to support New Practice Projects</p><p><strong>Stage 3</strong>: Publish Python Practice Projects</p><p><strong>Stage 4</strong>: Publish JavaScript Practice Projects to replace existing JavaScript lessons</p><h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1><h2 id="i-m-in-the-middle-of-the-current-curriculum-should-i-keep-going">I'm in the middle of the current curriculum. Should I keep going?</h2><p>Yes. Keep going. None of this will affect anything you're learning today. The new curriculum is fully backward compatible.</p><h2 id="i-ve-already-earned-certifications-with-the-current-curriculum-what-will-happen-to-these">I've already earned certifications with the current curriculum. What will happen to these?</h2><p>Congrats on your certifications. Good news: our current 6 certifications aren't changing. They will still be in the curriculum, and each of them will keep the same 5 Certification Projects.</p><p>Remember: in order to earn a certification, all you need to do is build its 5 Certification Projects. All the lessons are optional.</p><p>So even though we're replacing these lessons with Practice Projects, you won't need to go back and do these. The Practice Projects - just like the lessons - will be completely optional.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-other-changes-i-should-know-about">What are the other changes I should know about?</h2><p>We are changing the name of the "Quality Assurance and Information Security" certification to just be "Quality Assurance." We're doing this because we have a new certification focused just on Information Security.</p><p>The Quality Assurance certification will cover a lot more testing. Two of its old Certification Projects are being moved to the new Information Security certification. And we're replacing those with 2 new Quality Assurance Certification Projects.</p><p>If you've already earned the old Quality Assurance certification, you won't need to build these 2 new projects. But you can build them if you want for extra practice.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-do-all-3-000-hours-of-coursework-before-i-can-start-applying-for-jobs">Do I need to do all 3,000 hours of coursework before I can start applying for jobs?</h2><p>In practice, very few people complete the entire curriculum before going out and getting a job.</p><p>So don't think of this curriculum as "everything you should know before you start your job search."</p><p>Instead, think of this as: "everything a modern developer should know early in their career." You can keep learning new skills through the curriculum even after you've gotten your first developer job.</p><h2 id="can-i-apply-for-data-science-jobs-with-this">Can I apply for data science jobs with this?</h2><p>Data Science is a multi-disciplinary field that combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge. It is not an entry-level field, but rather a career you transition into once you get your Ph.D. or work a variety of jobs in industry.</p><p>We teach a lot of data science tools because these are valuable for generalist developers as well. Note that we do not teach the math or industry-specific domain knowledge you'd need as a data scientist. So if your goal is to become a data scientist, you'll probably want to learn those in school or on the job.</p><h2 id="how-can-i-help">How can I help?</h2><p>We are a tiny nonprofit with a comically small budget. But we are extremely efficient. In 2019 we provided more than 1.1 billion minutes of instruction on a budget of only $373,000. <strong>That comes out to 50 hours of instruction per dollar donated.</strong></p><p>The best way to help our mission is to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">support freeCodeCamp.org directly with a donation</a>.</p><p>You can also help by <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum">hanging out on the freeCodeCamp forum and answering people's questions</a>. We are now one of the biggest programming communities on the web, thanks to so many helpful volunteers.</p><p>Thanks again for being part of the freeCodeCamp community. <a href="/news/the-future-of-freecodecamp-5-year-anniversary/">2019 has been a year of groundwork</a>. 2020 will be the year that our efforts come to fruition.</p><p>I'm grateful that you'll be here with us as our community takes its next big step into the future.</p>
