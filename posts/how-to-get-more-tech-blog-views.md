<p>If you're a developer with a Twitter account, you've already seen everyone and their cat start a blog, YouTube channel, or Patreon. We all want to become stars, or at the very least, a recognizable name in the industry.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/09/cat-doesnt-always-blog.jpg" alt="cat-doesnt-always-blog"></p>
<p>And why not? Just a few benefits include</p>
<ul>
<li>You build a portfolio of content.</li>
<li>You retain knowledge and benefit others by teaching.</li>
<li>You build an audience and create content tailored to their tastes.</li>
<li>Finding a job becomes easier.</li>
<li>Companies begin applying to <em>you</em>! Most of us get recruiter emails, but top tech names receive <em>actual job offers</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="anyonecandoit">Anyone Can Do It</h2>
<p>It's never been easier to create content. Today's tools allow anyone with an internet connection to hop on stage and share their insights.</p>
<p>And like everything in life, this has tradeoffs.</p>
<p>✅ Content creators are empowered. Positive!</p>
<p>❌ It's now more difficult to stand out. This, ironically, could make content creators feel <em>less</em> empowered.</p>
<p>But no matter how tough the competition gets, the one thing that'll give you the biggest advantage is...</p>
<h2 id="createqualitycontent">Create Quality Content</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/10/create-quality-content.jpg" alt="create-quality-content"></p>
<p>Creating and sharing quality content is key. People won't stick around otherwise, no matter how good everything else is.</p>
<p>But how exactly do you do that?</p>
<h2 id="focusonthetechnottheblog">Focus on the Tech, Not the Blog</h2>
<p>This is priority #1 before optimizing your blog's layout, SEO, or marketing strategy. Make sure you understand your technology well! If you don't understand it, how can you help others understand it?</p>
<p>I look for topics that fit within the following criteria.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm passionate about the subject.</li>
<li>I can talk about it for 15 minutes or more.</li>
<li>I can explain it in multiple ways.</li>
<li>I've researched it <em>A LOT</em> and can now do one of those above things.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm also a fan of this quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it - Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideally you should shoot for this level of understanding. It'll change everything.</p>
<h2 id="thosewhocantdoteach">Those Who Can't Do, Teach</h2>
<p>It sounds strange, but I've found that your coding skills become rusty if all you do is blog!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/10/teach-and-do.jpeg" alt="teach-and-do"></p>
<p>Always remember that <em>teaching</em> and <em>doing</em> are two different things. If all you do is teach, you eventually become that person who knows everything in theory, but can't get anything done.</p>
<p>Make sure to balance the teaching/learning ratio by constantly challenging yourself. Do a side project, take on harder tasks at work, anything to sharpen your skills.</p>
<h2 id="enjoyyourself">Enjoy Yourself</h2>
<p>Blogging is not "get rich quick" scheme. It takes a long time of sharing quality content and can feel slow, hopeless, and destined to fail.</p>
<p>But if you enjoy yourself throughout the process, you'll build a solid content portfolio, benefit others, grow your brand (over time), and cement your hard-earned knowledge by sharing your insights on the global stage.</p>
<p>Take your time, prefer quality over quantity, and always challenge yourself.</p>
