Rated &lt;span itemprop="ratingValue"&gt;Actual Rating of Realtor&lt;/span&gt; out of &lt;span itemprop="bestRating"&gt;Highest Possible Rating of Realtor&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span itemprop="ratingCount"&gt;Number of Total Reviews&lt;/span&gt; clients at &lt;a href="URL of Website Where Reviews Are Located" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Name of Website Where Reviews Are Located&lt;/a&gt;
Fee Structure: &lt;span itemprop="priceRange"&gt;Commission&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre><p>Figuring out what structured data to use in a site, or on a particular page, can be difficult. Fortunately, Google gives a few tools that help with this. Let’s look at those tools in the following section of this article.</p><h3 id="testing-your-structured-data-and-monitoring-it-after-your-site-launches">Testing your structured data and monitoring it after your site launches</h3><p>The first step in adding structured data to your content is to figure out the category it falls into. You can do this by researching the Schema.org website, looking at the data from other websites, or a combination of both. Once you find the category you fall into, the rest is pretty easy. Let’s stick with the real estate agent example from above.</p><p>The first step is to add the realtor markup, from Schema, the site. Then enter your url into <a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool">Google’s structured data testing tool</a>. The tool will tell you what structured data has been found on your site, what errors you may have, and what structured data is “suggested” for the category you’ve selected. Once you start using this tool, you’ll find that making sure you have the right information in the website becomes fairly simple and straightforward. </p><p>Also, I heavily rely on the examples which Schema provides for various categories and data types. Using Google’s testing tool can help you to make sure that you have the correct data in your site from the get go.</p><p>Another important tool, in monitoring for errors, is <a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about">Google Search Console</a>. This is another developer tool, from Google, that will let you know when structured data errors appear on your website after launch. This is an incredibly useful tool and if you’re supporting your client’s website on an ongoing basis, after launch, then you need to be using it to monitor things.</p><h3 id="the-need-to-keep-your-structured-data-up-to-date-after-a-website-launches">The need to keep your structured data up to date after a website launches</h3><p>It is important to understand that you may need to go back and edit a site’s older structured data after a site launches. This is because, like many other things, the standards for structured data change over time. As an example, I build and maintain websites for law firms as part of my primary business. Under the prior structured data standards, these websites were marked up with the following:</p><p>&lt;itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Attorney&gt;</p><p>In later revisions to the structured data standards, however, the “Attorney” classification was deprecated and changed to “LegalService” – as such, I had to change the markup on each website I manage. I tell you this because it’s important to realize that these standards change somewhat often. It’s important that you keep up with the changes.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Web results are becoming increasingly rich in that they provide more information than just a link to a website. It’s important for your clients that you markup your pages accordingly. Doing so is important to your SEO efforts and to providing value to your customers. This is why it’s important to include structured data in your projects.</p><h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3><p>I am a web developer who primarily provides various types of services to law firms. I am also a co-founder of <a href="https://www.modern-website.design/">Modern Website Design</a>. I enjoy writing on issues which help freelance developers and small businesses to grow their revenue.</p>
