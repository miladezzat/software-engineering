<p>The web moves fast. Just a year or two of contentment could leave you eating JavaScript's dust.</p>
<p>Yet many developers, regardless of experience, frantically ask: "Which project should I do?"</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/which-project-should-i-do.jpeg" alt="which-project-should-i-do"></p>
<p>...only to receive these cryptic answers.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/john-cena-advice.jpg" alt="john-cena-advice"></p>
<p>In hopes of preventing that, I'd like to share some advice that's been very beneficial to me.</p>
<h2 id="copyuntilyoucancreate">Copy–until you can create</h2>
<p>Consider the following quote...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good artists copy; great artists steal. - Pablo Picasso</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't mean rob your parents.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/dont-steal-money.jpeg" alt="dont-steal-money"></p>
<p>It means, <em>while you're practicing</em>, don't bother with original ideas. Just copy something and focus on perfecting your technique!</p>
<p>You can rewrite the source code line-by-line, do it totally independently, or somewhere in-between.</p>
<h2 id="everyonesdoingit">Everyone's Doing It</h2>
<p>Aspiring artists and authors copy all the time. Whether it's redrawing or rewriting, mimicking a famous piece is a mind-opening exercise. You get to immerse yourself in the craft and not worry about formulating a good idea. All the focus goes toward improving your skills.</p>
<p>This applies to programming too! Myself and many other developers copy open source repos just to learn how they work. You discover techniques you might've never encountered before.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/emmanuel-ohans-medium-clap.gif" alt="emmanuel-ohans-medium-clap"></p>
<p>In his inspirational Medium Clap article, Emmanuel Ohans took this principle to the extreme. He figured out how to design his own project after copying countless Codrops repos.</p>
<p>It's not about plagiarizing original works–it's about improving your technique and drawing inspiration from others.</p>
<h2 id="howyoucandoit">How You Can Do It</h2>
<p>Find a project you'd like to copy, then pick one option...</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy its source code line-by-line</li>
<li>Look at source code only when you're stuck</li>
<li>Recreate it 100% by yourself</li>
<li>Just do something!</li>
</ol>
<p>All the choices are valid and beneficial. As you complete the project, research any syntax/patterns you find confusing.</p>
<h2 id="originalcodinglast">Original = Coding last</h2>
<p>If you only practice through original ideas, this will be your workflow.</p>
<ol>
<li>Thinking of something</li>
<li>Research</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Development (<strong>The very last step</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Looks pretty wasteful to me, unless you're running a startup company.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/batman-advises-robin.jpeg" alt="batman-advises-robin"></p>
<h2 id="copyingcodingfirst">Copying = Coding first</h2>
<p>For the ones who <em>just want to code</em>, consider this process instead.</p>
<ol>
<li>Code an existing app that interests you</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! The process is now aligned with our goals. Instead of developing at the very end, we're now developing all the way through.</p>
<p>The idea, research, planning, and design are all taken care of. We can focus on the good stuff, unlike poor Harold here.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/08/harold-got-no-ideas.jpeg" alt="harold-got-no-ideas"></p>
<p>He'll never improve because he's stuck in the idea phase. Don't make his mistake! Spend your resources on <em>practicing</em> instead of idea-making.</p>
<p>If that's your goal, at least. ?</p>
