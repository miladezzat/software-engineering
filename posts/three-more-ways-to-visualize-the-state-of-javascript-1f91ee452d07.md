<h4 id="we-gave-the-community-access-to-our-data-here-s-the-result">We gave the community access to our data. Here’s the result</h4>
<p>Last month we announced the <a href="https://medium.com/@sachagreif/announcing-the-state-of-javascript-2018-data-visualization-contest-4d75abad96c8" rel="noopener">State of JavaScript Dataviz Contest</a>: we gave the JavaScript community access to the <a href="http://2018.stateofjs.com" rel="noopener">State of JavaScript 2018 survey</a> data (you can <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sachag/state-of-javascript-2018" rel="noopener">find it here</a>), and we asked you to share any new visualizations you created with us in return.</p>
<p>We judged the entries according to three main criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Effort</strong>: how much time and care you put into your visualization.</li>
<li><strong>Usefulness</strong>: how insightful or useful your work is.</li>
<li><strong>Originality</strong>: for works that show out-of-the-box thinking or are just plain fun!</li>
</ol>
<p>So without further ado, here are the three contest winners who won a very exclusive State of JS x <a href="https://dotjs.io" rel="noopener">DotJS</a> t-shirt!</p>
<h3 id="state-of-js-galactic-edition-by-gregory-king">State of JS: Galactic Edition by Gregory King</h3>
<p>Greg’s <a href="https://kinxiel.github.io/state_of_js_GalacticEdition/" rel="noopener">State of JS: Galactic Edition</a> ticks all three boxes: it clearly took some effort to come up with that concept and add some visual polish; it’s useful as it surfaces some information that wasn’t even available in the survey (when each library was first released); and it’s certainly creative!</p>
<p>What I particularly like about this visualization is that it uses <em>movement speed</em> as a meaningful indicator to communicate the amount of interest in a technology.</p>
<p>I don’t think I’ve ever seen a data visualization make use of this dimension, and it certainly opens up a lot of possibilities that are unique to digital media!</p>
<h3 id="state-of-js-periodic-table-by-thomas-heyenbrock">State of JS Periodic Table by Thomas Heyenbrock</h3>
<p>Thomas took our periodic table theme and just ran with it. <a href="https://state-of-js.netlify.com/" rel="noopener">His own take on the JavaScript periodic table</a> is fully animated, and surfaces very interesting datapoints, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>which technology has the best documentation?</li>
<li>what technologies are the easiest to learn?</li>
<li>what technology has the highest momentum?</li>
</ul>
<p>And not only that, but you can even plot one of these questions against people’s opinions of the overall JavaScript ecosystem!</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered what technologies are used most commonly by developers who don’t enjoy using JavaScript, now you can find out!</p>
<h3 id="demographic-data-exploration-by-rub-n-valseca">Demographic Data Exploration by Rubén Valseca</h3>
<p>Ruben’s data visualization provides <a href="https://rubnvp.github.io/state-of-js-2018-visualization/" rel="noopener">a detailed country-by-country breakdown</a> of our results.</p>
<p>Do female JavaScript developers in Norway earn more than their Japanese counterparts? Answer: yes, they do! And thanks to Ruben we’ve now got the data to prove it.</p>
<p>Congrats to our three winners, and thanks to everybody who participated! You can check out the full list of submissions <a href="https://github.com/StateOfJS/StateOfJS/issues/151" rel="noopener">in this GitHub thread</a>, and stay tuned for more State of JS news coming soon!</p>
