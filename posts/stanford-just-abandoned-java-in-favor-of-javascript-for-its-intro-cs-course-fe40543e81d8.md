<p>The Stanford professor who wrote a popular book on Java — and has taught Java for 15 years — is now abandoning Java in favor of JavaScript for his introductory computer science courses.</p><p>Stanford’s website explains that their new CS 106J course “covers the same material as [older course] CS 106A but does so using JavaScript, the most common language for implementing interactive web pages, instead of Java.”</p><p>This isn’t the end of Java, which has decades worth of tools and codebases built up, and is still used by many large corporations. Rather, this is just a sign of the times.</p><p>JavaScript is truly open source and owned by no one, whereas Java is essentially owned by Oracle through its 2010 acquisition of Sun Microsystems. And Oracle has a <a href="https://fcc.im/2op2Svx" rel="noopener">less-than-stellar track record</a> of honoring open source licenses.</p><p><strong>I only write about programming and technology. If you <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia" rel="noopener">follow me on Twitter</a> I won’t waste your time. ?</strong></p>
