<p>In this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp podcast, Abbey chats with Greek developer and designer Eleftheria Batsou about her passion for creating content and how she balances work, school, travel, and personal time. </p><p>Eleftheria moved around a lot when she was young, but settled in Thessaloniki in northern Greece as a teenager. When she had to decide which track to take in school, she picked technology, science, and math. It turned out to be a good decision!</p><p>After bouncing around a bit and completing some internships, Eleftheria found a place that suited her. She learned to code by supplementing her education with free online resources (like freeCodeCamp!), leveled up her skills by completing numerous challenges like #100DaysofCode, and realized she had a passion for design as well as front-end development. </p><p>Today, she works as a developer, she's getting her Master's degree in design, she attends numerous conferences throughout Europe - and speaks at many of them - and she has a growing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-WwYv3DEW7Nkm_IP6VeQQ">YouTube channel</a>. She also has a <a href="http://eleftheriabatsou.com/blog">blog</a> where she shares all kinds of tips, tutorials, and bits of knowledge for beginning developers.</p><p>When she's not busy juggling her many tasks, she likes to workout to clear her head and hang out with her friends.</p><p>This interview is about a 1 hour listen in your favorite podcast player app - just search for "freecodecamp" and you should find it.</p><p>If you have an Amazon Echo, you can just say "Alexa - play the freeCodeCamp podcast."</p><p>Or you can listen to it <a href="http://podcast.freecodecamp.org/ep-70-how-one-young-developer-masters-student-and-youtuber-does-it-all">right here in your browser</a>.</p><p>Find Eleftheria on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BatsouElef">here</a>.</p><p>Visit her website <a href="http://eleftheriabatsou.com/">here</a>.</p>
