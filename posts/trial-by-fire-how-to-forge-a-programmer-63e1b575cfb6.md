<h4 id="6-september-2017"><strong>6 September 2017</strong></h4><p>Sweat is running down my face. I’m staring down a blank sublime text document. What on earth am I doing? My hands are resting above the keyboard of my MacBook pro.</p><p>There is enough friction to cuddle each of the keyboard buttons my fingers are resting on.</p><p>It’s like apologizing to them for not using them yet.</p><p>It’s late at night, and I’ve decided to jump in head first, creating my own app using React and Firebase.</p><p>How, I don’t know.</p><p>I only know that I’m going to do it, no matter what my imposter syndrome has to say about it.</p><p>I have made the decision.</p><p>My fingers move. The keyboard hives a sigh of relief in the form of a satisfying <em>click</em> sound.</p><p>I’m doing it!</p><h4 id="12-september-2017"><strong>12 September 2017</strong></h4><p>Despair, my old friend. Late nights have been a recurring theme over the past week.</p><p>If anyone hacked my webcam, I would pity them.</p><p>They’d see a wide-eyed, tired, obsessive and wild programmer staring at the screen in an intent manner.</p><p>Alas, my compulsive behavior does not allow me to go to bed before every single bug is resolved.</p><p>Not a very healthy trait for a programmer, but a trait all the same.</p><p>The Ajax requests I put into my application are silently taunting me.</p><p>Every failed one yelling — “You’re an idiot”.</p><p>Ok, they are not so silent after all.</p><p>At this point, I’m at war.</p><p>And you don’t sleep while you’re at war.</p><p>The fight continues.</p><h4 id="13-september-2017"><strong>13 September 2017</strong></h4><p>VICTORY. The enemy is subdued.</p><p>I wielded mighty Javascript Promises and beat them into submission.</p><p>Now I’m the one yelling at the Ajax requests. But instead of silently yelling, I’m actually yelling — “Haha, you’re working”.</p><p>Again, it’s late.</p><p>My girlfriend is not happy.</p><p>Being a gracious winner is overrated.</p><h4 id="14-september-2017"><strong>14 September 2017</strong></h4><p>I refactored and broke the entire App. FML!</p><h4 id="15-september-2017"><strong>15 September 2017</strong></h4><p>StackOverflow and various tutorial sites on the internet have become my second home.</p><p>I managed to <em>fix</em> the app.</p><h4 id="16-september-2017"><strong>16 September 2017</strong></h4><p>The app looks like trash. Like super trash, like what a toddler would create, if a toddler could code.</p><p>Imagine a toddlers drawing, that is my App. I need CSS.</p><p>I cringe. It’s time to prepare. Prepare for frustration. Hours and hours of frustration.</p><p>I am not excited.</p><h4 id="20-september-2017"><strong>20 September 2017</strong></h4><p>The App looks good!</p><p>I’m excited.</p><h4 id="22-september-2017"><strong>22 September 2017</strong></h4><p>I realize my desktop layout will never work on mobile.</p><p>I decide to create a different mobile website based on some of the components I already have.</p><h4 id="27-september-2017"><strong>27 September 2017</strong></h4><p>I decide to trash the entire visual direction of my website. My mobile site looks NOTHING like my desktop site.</p><p>For the past 5 days I’ve been on a brilliant coding high.</p><p>Splitting and reusing components. Resulting in a great mobile site that looks miles better than the desktop.</p><p>Sure, CSS did cause some frustration.</p><blockquote>Yet, when you’re on top of the rainbow dancing to Bob Marley, not even CSS can bring you down.</blockquote><h4 id="1-october-2017"><strong>1 October 2017</strong></h4><p>It’s 6 AM. I’ve been working all night. I’m going to press the magic button. I’m launching it!</p><p>I’m tired, but there is no sleep to be had.</p><p>Instead I’m going to sit and watch Google Analytics for the rest of the day. The world is going to LOVE my product right?</p><p>My brilliant launch strategy is to create <strong>one</strong> Facebook post. I created the post in a crowded entrepreneurship forum.</p><p>One user.</p><p>Two users.</p><p>Three users.</p><p>It’s working!</p><h4 id="2-october-2017"><strong>2 October 2017</strong></h4><p>I have 50 users, great success.</p><h4 id="5-october-2017"><strong>5 October 2017</strong></h4><p>All users are going inactive. There is no activity on the website. Bounce rate is above 80%. I’m crying in the shower. Beer might also be there. And to top it off, it’s my birthday.</p><h4 id="6-october-2017"><strong>6 October 2017</strong></h4><p>I decide to improve the app. First order of business is to improve the visuals of the desktop version to match the mobile.</p><p>I’m still crying, this time because I know I will have to do CSS <em>again</em>.</p><h4 id="13-october-2017"><strong>13 October 2017</strong></h4><p>Success! Another enemy conquered. I forced CSS to <em>bend</em> to my will and create an appealing dashboard. Yes, it’s a love / hate relationship, I don’t deny it.</p><h4 id="14-october-2017"><strong>14 October 2017</strong></h4><p>I decide to improve the landing page. Ugh, more CSS.</p><h4 id="27-october-2017"><strong>27 October 2017</strong></h4><p>I made it out… I didn’t think I would. I decided to experiment with CSS transform. Rotating, scaling, translating. My head is spinning. I can’t even…</p><p>So tired.</p><p>I’m going to wake up tomorrow and discover that this is all a dream, aren’t I? If so, please don’t give me any more dreams like this. I can’t take it.</p><h4 id="1-november-2017"><strong>1 November 2017</strong></h4><p>I slept for three days. It wasn’t a dream. The App looks good. I am happy.</p><p>It’s live: <a href="https://cryptodasher.com/" rel="noopener"><em>https://cryptodasher.com</em></a></p><p><em>This is a comical representation of my experience developing <a href="https://cryptodasher.com/" rel="noopener">CryptoDasher</a>. An App for tracking and storing your cryptocurrency information. It may be slightly exaggerated, but it’s all true.</em></p>
