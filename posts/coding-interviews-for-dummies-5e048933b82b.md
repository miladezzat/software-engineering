The two values represent a start and an end value. Interval questions are considered to be part of the array family, but they involve some common techniques. Hence, they have their own special section.</p><p>An example of an interval array: <code>[[1, 2], [4, 7]]</code>.</p><p>Interval questions can be tricky for those who do not have experience with them. This is because of the sheer number of cases to consider when interval arrays overlap.</p><p>Clarify with the interviewer whether <code>[1, 2]</code> and <code>[2, 3]</code> are considered overlapping intervals, because it affects how you will write your equality checks.</p><p>A common routine for interval questions is to sort the array of intervals by the start value of each interval.</p><p>Be familiar with writing code to check if two intervals overlap and to merge two overlapping intervals:</p><pre><code class="language-js">def is_overlap(a, b):
return a[0] &lt; b[1] and b[0] &lt; a[1]

The benefit of linked lists is that insertion and deletion of code from anywhere in the list is O(1), whereas in arrays, the elements have to be shifted.</p><p>Adding a dummy node at the head and /or tail might help to handle many edge cases where operations have to be performed at the head or the tail. The presence of dummy nodes ensures that operations will never have be executed on the head or the tail. Dummy nodes remove the headache of writing conditional checks to deal with null pointers. Be sure to remove them at the end of the operation.</p><p>Sometimes linked lists problem can be solved without additional storage. Try to borrow ideas from the for reverse a linked list problem.</p><p>For deletion in linked lists, you can either modify the node values or change the node pointers. You might need to keep a reference to the previous element.</p><p>For partitioning linked lists, create two separate linked lists and join them back together.</p><p>Linked lists problems share similarities with array problems. Think about how you would solve an array problem and apply it to a linked list.</p><p>Two pointer approaches are also common for linked lists:</p><ul><li>Getting the kth<strong> </strong>from the last node: Have two pointers, where one is <em>k</em> nodes ahead of the other. When the node ahead reaches the end, the other node is <em>k</em> nodes behind.</li><li>Detecting cycles: Have two pointers, where one pointer increments twice as much as the other. If the two pointers meet, it means that there is a cycle.</li><li>Getting the middle node: Have two pointers. One pointer increments twice as much as the other. When the faster node reaches the end of the list, the slower node will be at the middle.</li></ul><p>Be familiar with the following routines because many linked list questions make use of one or more of these routines in their solution.</p><ul><li>Count the number of nodes in the linked list</li><li>Reverse a linked list in place</li><li>Find the middle node of the linked list using fast or slow pointers</li><li>Merge two lists together</li></ul><h4 id="corner-cases-4">Corner Cases</h4><ul><li>Single node</li><li>Two nodes</li><li>Linked list has cycle. Clarify with the interviewer whether there can be a cycle in the list.

At the very least, mention that overflow or underflow is possible and ask whether you need to handle it.</p><p>Consider negative numbers and floating point numbers. This may sound obvious, but when you are under pressure in an interview, many obvious points go unnoticed.</p><p>If the question asks to implement an operator such as power, squareroot, or division, and it is to be faster than O(n), binary search is usually the approach.</p><h4 id="some-common-formulas"><strong>Some common formulas</strong></h4><ul><li>Sum of 1 to N = (n+1) * n/2</li><li>Sum of GP = 2⁰ + 2¹ + 2² + 2³ + … 2^n = 2^(n+1)-1</li><li>Permutations of N = N! / (N-K)!</li><li>Combinations of N = N! / (K! * (N-K)!)</li></ul><h4 id="corner-cases-5">Corner Cases</h4><ul><li>Division by 0</li><li>Integer overflow and underflow</li></ul><h4 id="practice-questions-6">Practice Questions</h4><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/" rel="noopener">Pow(x, n)</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/" rel="noopener">Sqrt(x)</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-english-words/" rel="noopener">Integer to English Words</a></li></ul><h3 id="matrix">Matrix</h3><h4 id="notes-9">Notes</h4><p>A matrix is a 2-dimensional array. Questions involving matrices are usually related to dynamic programming or graph traversal.</p><p>For questions involving traversal or dynamic programming, make a copy of the matrix with the same dimensions that are initialized to empty values. Use these values to store the visited state or dynamic programming table. Be familiar with this routine:</p><pre><code class="language-py">rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
copy = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)</code></pre><ul><li>Many grid-based games can be modeled as a matrix. For example, Tic-Tac-Toe, Sudoku, Crossword, Connect 4, and Battleship. It is not uncommon to be asked to verify the winning condition of the game. For games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4, and Crosswords, verification has to be done vertically and horizontally. One trick is to write code to verify the matrix for the horizontal cells. Then transpose the matrix, reusing the logic used for horizontal verification to verify originally vertical cells (which are now horizontal).</li><li>Transposing a matrix in Python is simply:</li></ul><pre><code class="language-py">transposed_matrix = zip(*matrix)</code></pre><h4 id="corner-cases-6">Corner Cases</h4><ul><li>Empty matrix. Check that none of the arrays are 0 length.</li><li>1 x 1 matrix.</li><li>Matrix with only one row or column.</li></ul><h4 id="practice-questions-7">Practice Questions</h4><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/" rel="noopener">Set Matrix Zeroes</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/" rel="noopener">Spiral Matrix</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/" rel="noopener">Rotate Image</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/" rel="noopener">Word Search</a></li></ul><h3 id="recursion">Recursion</h3><h4 id="notes-10">Notes</h4><p>Recursion is useful for permutation, because it generates all combinations and tree-based questions. You should know how to generate all permutations of a sequence as well as how to handle duplicates.</p><p>Remember to always define a base case so that your recursion will end.</p><p>Recursion implicitly uses a stack. Hence all recursive approaches can be rewritten iteratively using a stack. Beware of cases where the recursion level goes too deep and causes a stack overflow (the default limit in Python is 1000). You may get bonus points for pointing this out to the interviewer. Recursion will never be O(1) space complexity because a stack is involved, unless there is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/310974/what-is-tail-call-optimization" rel="noopener">tail call optimization</a> (TCO). Find out if your chosen language supports TCO.</p><h4 id="practice-questions-8">Practice Questions</h4><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/" rel="noopener">Subsets</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/" rel="noopener">Subsets II</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/strobogrammatic-number-ii/" rel="noopener">Strobogrammatic Number II</a></li></ul><h3 id="string">String</h3><h4 id="notes-11">Notes</h4><p>Please read the above tips on <a href="https://github.com/yangshun/tech-interview-handbook/tree/master/algorithms#sequence" rel="noopener">sequence</a>. They apply to strings too.</p><p>Ask about input character set and case sensitivity. Usually the characters are limited to lowercase Latin characters, for example a to z.</p><p>When you need to compare strings where the order isn’t important (like anagram), you may consider using a HashMap as a counter. If your language has a built-in <code>Counter</code> class like Python, ask to use that instead.</p><p>If you need to keep a counter of characters, a common mistake is to say that the space complexity required for the counter is O(n). The space required for a counter is O(1) not O(n). This is because the upper bound is the range of characters, which is usually a fixed constant of 26. The input set is just lowercase Latin characters.</p><p>Common data structures for looking up strings efficiently are</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trie" rel="noopener">Trie/Prefix Tree</a></li><li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Suffix_tree" rel="noopener">Suffix Tree</a></li></ul><p>Common string algorithms are</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Rabin%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm" rel="noopener">Rabin Karp</a>, which conducts efficient searches of substrings, using a rolling hash</li><li><a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm" rel="noopener">KMP</a>, which conducts efficient searches of substrings</li></ul><h4 id="non-repeating-characters">Non-repeating characters</h4><p>Use a 26-bit bitmask to indicate which lower case Latin characters are inside the string.</p><pre><code class="language-py">mask = 0
for c in set(word):
mask |= (1 &lt;&lt; (ord(c) - ord('a')))</code></pre><p>To determine if two strings have common characters, perform <code>&amp;</code> on the two bitmasks. If the result is non-zero, <code>mask_a &amp; mask_b &gt; 0</code> , then the two strings have common characters.</p><h4 id="anagram">Anagram</h4><p>An anagram is word switch or word play. It is the result of re-arranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, while using all the original letters only once. In interviews, usually we are only bothered with words without spaces in them.</p><p>To determine if two strings are anagrams, there are a few plausible approaches:</p><ul><li>Sorting both strings should produce the same resulting string. This takes O(nlgn) time and O(lgn) space.</li><li>If we map each character to a prime number and we multiply each mapped number together, anagrams should have the same multiple (prime factor decomposition). This takes O(n) time and O(1) space.</li><li>Frequency counting of characters will help to determine if two strings are anagrams. This also takes O(n) time and O(1) space.</li></ul><h4 id="palindrome">Palindrome</h4><p>A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word, phrase, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number" rel="noopener">number</a>, or other sequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(symbol)" rel="noopener">characters</a> that reads the same backward and forward, such as <em>madam</em> or <em>racecar</em>.</p><p>Here are ways to determine if a string is a palindrome:</p><ul><li>Reverse the string and it should be equal to itself.</li><li>Have two pointers at the start and end of the string. Move the pointers inward till they meet. At any point in time, the characters at both pointers should match.</li></ul><p>The order of characters within the string matters, so HashMaps are usually not helpful.</p><p>When a question is about counting the number of palindromes, a common trick is to have two pointers that move outward, away from the middle. Note that palindromes can be even or odd length. For each middle pivot position, you need to check it twice: Once that includes the character and once without the character.</p><ul><li>For substrings, you can terminate early once there is no match.</li><li>For subsequences, use dynamic programming as there are overlapping subproblems. Check out <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/" rel="noopener">this question</a>.</li></ul><h4 id="corner-cases-7">Corner Cases</h4><ul><li>Empty string</li><li>Single-character string</li><li>Strings with only one distinct character</li></ul><h4 id="practice-questions-9">Practice Questions</h4><ul><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/" rel="noopener">Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/" rel="noopener">Longest Repeating Character Replacement</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/" rel="noopener">Minimum Window Substring</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/" rel="noopener">Encode and Decode Strings</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram" rel="noopener">Valid Anagram</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/" rel="noopener">Group Anagrams</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses" rel="noopener">Valid Parentheses</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/" rel="noopener">Valid Palindrome</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/" rel="noopener">Longest Palindromic Substring</a></li><li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/" rel="noopener">Palindromic Substrings</a></li></ul><h3 id="tree">Tree</h3><h4 id="study-links-3">Study Links</h4><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/basecs/leaf-it-up-to-binary-trees-11001aaf746d" rel="noopener">Leaf It Up To Binary Trees</a></li></ul><h4 id="notes-12">Notes</h4><p>A tree is an undirected and connected acyclic graph.</p><p>Recursion is a common approach for trees. When you notice that the subtree problem can be used to solve the entire problem, try using recursion.</p><p>When using recursion, always remember to check for the base case, usually where the node is <code>null</code>.</p><p>When you are asked to traverse a tree by level, use depth first search.</p><p>Sometimes it is possible that your recursive function needs to return two values.</p><p>If the question involves summation of nodes along the way, be sure to check whether nodes can be negative.</p><p>You should be very familiar with writing pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal recursively. As an extension, challenge yourself by writing them iteratively. Sometimes interviewers ask candidates for the iterative approach, especially if the candidate finishes writing the recursive approach too quickly.</p><h4 id="binary-tree">Binary tree</h4><p>In-order traversal of a binary tree is insufficient to uniquely serialize a tree.
