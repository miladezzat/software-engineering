</code></pre><p>It's the same as before, but with a second part for the description. So, "-m 'title' " lets you write the short title of the commit, and "-m 'description' " lets you write the description if you need to give more details.</p><h3 id="use-git-guidelines">Use git guidelines</h3><p>If you want to have a clear git commit history, you should follow some guidelines. In my case, I chose <a href="http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/">this simple one from Udacity</a>. </p><p>There are a lot of others, like <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit">Angular Guideline</a>. A commit guideline will help you give structure to your commits. </p><p>For example, adding a tag to clarify what you did: "git commit -m 'fix: correctly delete all user information when the button delete account is triggered'".</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I hope that you liked this guide on how to commit to Git! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to ask.</p><p>If you have any other tips on how to make good commits, please let me know.</p><p>If you want more content like this, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/gaelgthomas/">follow me on Twitter</a>, where I tweet about web development, self-improvement, and my journey as a full stack developer!</p>
