<h1 id="building-my-extra-curricular-music-app">Building my Extra-curricular Music App</h1>
<p>I’ve been quite absent on Free Code Camp since my last post, which outlined <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/my-first-month-at-freecodecamp-781c591357f1#.al4qqeuny" rel="noopener">my first month going through the program</a>. What went wrong? Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a project for my own personal use. I’m using the skills that I picked up by working through Free Code Camp’s front-end development courses. And I couldn’t be more excited about what I’ve been able to accomplish so far.</p>
<p>I had a problem and I wanted to build something to fix it.</p>
<figcaption>And use a suitably large wrench in the process.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’m constantly listening to music. Almost every waking hour of the day I have something playing in the background.</p>
<p>I primarily use Spotify and Soundcloud, and I rarely download anything. I use Soundcloud to listen to tunes from more unknown artists, and I use Spotify for bigger, label-released tunes.</p>
<p>I sometimes use playlists with Spotify, primarily because their recommendation engine is so good and I can get an incredible mood-based playlist based off that. However with Soundcloud I primarily go through my feed and favorite the songs that I want to listen to more. I don’t add them to a playlist because, well, I just don’t. I like listening to the newest songs I find until I can’t stand them anymore.</p>
<p>Traditionally, I’d play through my favorites section in Soundcloud like a playlist. The order wouldn’t be exactly what I wanted, but I could still have a constant stream of good tunes that I liked.</p>
<p>Spotify has a queue function where I can basically create a running, temporary playlist. For example, I’m not going to put Rave After Rave by W&amp;W and Marvin’s Room by Drake in the same playlist, but I may have an itch to hear both back to back when I’m hanging at my computer coding. Spotify let’s me do this, but Soundcloud (which I use more than Spotify) does not.</p>
<p>After finishing my Ziplines for Free Code Camp, I got to work on my personal project. I was going to build a queue function for Soundcloud!</p>
<p>When you’re going through your Ziplines it’s fairly easy to find resources to help on a specific problem you’re having. This is because thousands of people have built the same application, and many had similar problems as you.</p>
<p>When building something on your own, there’s a good chance that someone hasn’t done the exact same thing you’re doing. They may have done something similar, but not the exact same. This is a perfect opportunity to hone your googling skills! It’s important to try and think in code and phrase your question in a way that another programmer may ask it on StackOverflow.</p>
<p>To be honest, I had been mapping out the project for a couple weeks while working on my Simon game and Tic Tac Toe application for Free Code Camp. After finishing my last Zipline I started building my Soundcloud queue app.</p>
<p>I started reading the docs on Soundcloud’s API and reasoned to myself that this wasn’t going to be <em>that</em> hard. To be honest, it wasn’t that hard, but there were a ton of bumps in the road that I had to go through.</p>
<p>The API docs that Soundcloud provides are pretty bare and there are quite a few broken methods. Surprisingly, I feel like this was a blessing in disguise. It taught me that not everything is perfect (and my app sure isn’t), but as a developer you <em>need </em>to be able to work through the hiccups.</p>
<p>I used StackOverflow extensively, and also had to learn some fundamentals about how JS actually works. I still don’t understand how JS works, but I’ll get there. This is a long road, remember?</p>
<p>The feeling when I got one song to play after another was unbelievable. It was the core function of my app, and I was able to figure out how to do it. I literally fist pumped in my apartment for a good 5 minutes, then immediately texted my Mom and tried to explain to her what I’d accomplished (to no avail).</p>
<p>Then I walked to my favorite curry place for a celebratory meal and a Victoria Bitter.</p>
<p>However, my journey was not even close to done. As many say with regards to programming:</p>
<blockquote>“Fix one thing, break 48 more things!”</blockquote>
<p>That’s exactly what happened, but I knew I could get through it. Plus, I still needed to add functionality like being able to delete a song from the queue, and change the order of songs that were already in the queue.</p>
<p>The bright side was that I was actually able to use the app and queue songs on Soundcloud while I was coding it. In fact, I’m using it as I write this.</p>
<p>I’m still working on getting my app to work on mobile. iOS and Android don’t allow things to auto-play in Safari or Chrome. This makes things difficult, but I know that there is a way.</p>
<p>Soundcloud’s mobile site takes a click input from the user and then is able to play sounds continuously after that. I still haven’t figured out how they do it, but i’m working on it!</p>
<p>Another way would be to make a native app. I’m not going to learn Swift or Java yet. But I may try to learn how Cordova works to port this so I can use it on my phone.</p>
<p>While making this project it reminded me a lot of creating music. Whenever I’d make a song and post it, it was never complete. I would always notice a little too much reverb somewhere, or want some white noise here, or a cymbal there. It was never “finished” and I don’t think this project will ever be “finished” in my eyes either. I’ll always have little ideas that I want to implement so it will be ever-changing!</p>
<p>I feel like I can finally say that I’m a programmer. A very beginner programmer, but still a programmer.</p>
<p>I made something that solved a problem for me and I use it every day.</p>
<p>As you make your way through the Free Code Camp curriculum, be sure to keep thinking of personal things that you’ll want to build with your newfound skills.</p>
<p>As you learn new methods and build your Ziplines, think about how you can take what you’re learning and put it to use to make your life better.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about making the next big thing. Just keep learning and building things that you think are cool.</p>
<p>I’m hesitant on putting the link to my app here because SoundCloud has a 15,000/song per day API limit, but I’ll do it anyway because I think it’s cool. And maybe others will as well.</p>
<p>If we can make it hit the API limit, maybe Soundcloud will take note and implement this feature themselves. In the end that’s all I really want.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://queuethat.com/" rel="noopener">check out my app here</a>. I’m still working on my design skills, and the app is under heavy development, but it should be stable. Here’s hoping you find it useful.</p>
<p>I’ll be moving to Bali for two months and going through Free Code Camp’s back end program. I already have some cool ideas for this app where I’ll be able to utilize my new Node.js skills.</p>
<p>If anyone is looking for a hungry junior developer who is ecstatic about learning new technologies, please <a href="https://twitter.com/ElliottMcNary" rel="noopener">reach out to me on Twitter</a> (and follow me, too). I’ll be back in the USA in May.</p>
<p>Until then, keep brainstorm those extracurricular projects. The day will soon come when you’re ready to start building them.</p>
