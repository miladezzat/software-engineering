<p>There are three different approaches to machine learning, depending on the data you have. You can go with supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, or unsupervised learning. </p><p>In supervised learning you have labeled data, so you have outputs that you know for sure are the correct values for your inputs. That's like knowing car prices based on features like make, model, style, drivetrain, and other attributes.</p><p>With semi-supervised learning, you have a large data set where some of the data is labeled but most of it isn't. </p><p>This covers a large amount of real world data because it can be expensive to get an expert to label every data point. You can work around this by using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning.</p><p>Unsupervised learning means you have a data set that is completely unlabeled. You donâ€™t know if there are any patterns hidden in the data, so you leave it to the algorithm to find anything it can. </p><p>That's where clustering algorithms come in. It's one of the methods you can use in an unsupervised learning problem.</p><h2 id="what-are-clustering-algorithms">What are clustering algorithms?</h2><p>Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning task. You might also hear this referred to as cluster analysis because of the way this method works. </p><p>Using a clustering algorithm means you're going to give the algorithm a lot of input data with no labels and let it find any groupings in the data it can.</p><p>Those groupings are called <em>clusters</em>. A cluster is a group of data points that are similar to each other based on their relation to surrounding data points. Clustering is used for things like feature engineering or pattern discovery. </p><p>When you're starting with data you know nothing about, clustering might be a good place to get some insight. </p><h2 id="types-of-clustering-algorithms">Types of clustering algorithms</h2><p>There are different types of clustering algorithms that handle all kinds of unique data.</p><h3 id="density-based">Density-based</h3><p>In density-based clustering, data is grouped by areas of high concentrations of data points surrounded by areas of low concentrations of data points. Basically the algorithm finds the places that are dense with data points and calls those clusters.</p><p>The great thing about this is that the clusters can be any shape. You aren't constrained to expected conditions. </p><p>The clustering algorithms under this type don't try to assign outliers to clusters, so they get ignored.</p><h3 id="distribution-based">Distribution-based</h3><p>With a distribution-based clustering approach, all of the data points are considered parts of a cluster based on the probability that they belong to a given cluster. </p><p>It works like this: there is a center-point, and as the distance of a data point from the center increases, the probability of it being a part of that cluster decreases. </p><p>If you aren't sure of how the distribution in your data might be, you should consider a different type of algorithm.</p><h3 id="centroid-based">Centroid-based</h3><p>Centroid-based clustering is the one you probably hear about the most. It's a little sensitive to the initial parameters you give it, but it's fast and efficient. </p><p>These types of algorithms separate data points based on multiple centroids in the data. Each data point is assigned to a cluster based on its squared distance from the centroid. This is the most commonly used type of clustering.</p><h3 id="hierarchical-based">Hierarchical-based</h3><p>Hierarchical-based clustering is typically used on hierarchical data, like you would get from a company database or taxonomies. It builds a tree of clusters so everything is organized from the top-down. </p><p>This is more restrictive than the other clustering types, but it's perfect for specific kinds of data sets.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-clustering">When to use clustering</h2><p>When you have a set of unlabeled data, it's very likely that you'll be using some kind of unsupervised learning algorithm. </p><p>There are a lot of different unsupervised learning techniques, like neural networks, reinforcement learning, and clustering. The specific type of algorithm you want to use is going to depend on what your data looks like.</p><p>You might want to use clustering when you're trying to do anomaly detection to try and find outliers in your data. It helps by finding those groups of clusters and showing the boundaries that would determine whether a data point is an outlier or not. </p><p>If you aren't sure of what features to use for your machine learning model, clustering discovers patterns you can use to figure out what stands out in the data.</p><p>Clustering is especially useful for exploring data you know nothing about. It might take some time to figure out which type of clustering algorithm works the best, but when you do, you'll get invaluable insight on your data. You might find connections you never would have thought of.</p><p>Some real world applications of clustering include fraud detection in insurance, categorizing books in a library, and customer segmentation in marketing. It can also be used in larger problems, like earthquake analysis or city planning.</p><h2 id="the-top-8-clustering-algorithms">The Top 8 Clustering Algorithms</h2><p>Now that you have some background on how clustering algorithms work and the different types available, we can talk about the actual algorithms you'll commonly see in practice. </p><p>We'll implement these algorithms on an example data set from the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sklearn library</a> in Python.</p><p>We'll be using the <em>make_classification</em> data set from the sklearn library to demonstrate how different clustering algorithms aren't fit for all clustering problems. </p><p>You can find <a href="https://github.com/flippedcoder/probable-waddle">the code for all of the following example here</a>.</p><h3 id="k-means-clustering-algorithm">K-means clustering algorithm</h3><p>K-means clustering is the most commonly used clustering algorithm. It's a centroid-based algorithm and the simplest unsupervised learning algorithm. </p><p>This algorithm tries to minimize the variance of data points within a cluster. It's also how most people are introduced to unsupervised machine learning.</p><p>K-means is best used on smaller data sets because it iterates over <em>all</em> of the data points. That means it'll take more time to classify data points if there are a large amount of them in the data set. </p><p>Since this is how k-means clusters data points, it doesn't scale well.</p><p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-Python">from&nbsp;numpy&nbsp;import&nbsp;unique

There are some very specifically tuned clustering algorithms that quickly and precisely handle your data. Here are a few of the others that might be of interest to you.</p><p>There's another hierarchical algorithm that's the opposite of the agglomerative approach. It starts with a top-down clustering strategy. So it will start with one large root cluster and break out the individual clusters from there. </p><p>This is known as the <strong>Divisive Hierarchical</strong> clustering algorithm. There's research that shows this is creates more accurate hierarchies than agglomerative clustering, but it's way more complex.</p><p><strong>Mini-Batch K-means</strong> is similar to K-means, except that it uses small random chunks of data of a fixed size so they can be stored in memory. This helps it run faster than K-means so it converges to a solution in less time. </p><p>The drawback to this algorithm is that the speed boost will cost you some cluster quality.</p><p>The last algorithm we'll briefly cover is <strong>Spectral Clustering</strong>. This algorithm is completely different from the others we've looked at. </p><p>It works by taking advantage of graph theory. This algorithm doesn't make any initial guesses about the clusters that are in the data set. It treats data points like nodes in a graph and clusters are found based on communities of nodes that have connecting edges.</p><h2 id="other-thoughts">Other thoughts</h2><p>Watch out for scaling issues with the clustering algorithms. Your data set could have millions of data points, and since clustering algorithms work by calculating the similarities between all pairs of data points, you might end up with an algorithm that doesnâ€™t scale well.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Clustering algorithms are a great way to learn new things from old data. Sometimes you'll be surprised by the resulting clusters you get and it might help you make sense of a problem. </p><p>One of the coolest things about using clustering for unsupervised learning is that you can use the results in a supervised learning problem.</p><p>The clusters could be your new features that you use on a completely different data set! You can use clustering on just about any unsupervised machine learning problem, but make sure that you know how to analyze the results for accuracy.</p>
