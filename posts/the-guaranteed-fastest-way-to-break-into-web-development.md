<p>I'm not kidding, it's really that simple.<br>
If you've internalized this, stop reading and go work.</p>
<h2 id="projectseverywhere">Projects Everywhere</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you get the job, you'll do <strong>projects</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you find a better job, you'll lead <strong>projects</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you open that multi-million dollar consulting company you're dreaming of, you'll run <strong>many projects</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So to become a distinguished developer you must—say it with me now—<strong>do lots of projects</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="whataboutbooksandcourses">What About Books and Courses?</h2>
<p>In theory, they're great.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/harold-bought-another-udemy-course-1.png" alt="harold-bought-another-udemy-course-1"></p>
<p>But in reality, they can be a brilliant source of procrastination.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/harold-wont-finish-his-course-3.png" alt="harold-wont-finish-his-course-3"></p>
<p>Of all your learning material, how much did you finish? Even better, how much of it directly impacted your career?</p>
<p>Little to none? Trust me I've been there. My own physical and virtual libraries are packed with the same dusty volumes.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/your-books-arent-helping.jpeg" alt="your-books-arent-helping"></p>
<p>It's because we're doing it backwards.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/just-do-a-project.jpeg" alt="just-do-a-project"></p>
<h2 id="usethemasreferences">Use Them as References</h2>
<p>First tackle a problem or interesting idea, then <em>maybe</em> buy something. Because without action, books and courses are just interesting information.</p>
<p>You'll sound very smart, but you won't be very useful.</p>
<p>In the context of a project, however, all of that information is invaluable to better understanding your problem space.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/this-is-better-2.jpeg" alt="this-is-better-2"></p>
<p>I love books! I'm not saying "Don't read".</p>
<p>I'm saying find a project that intimidates you a little. Try to complete it, then use your material as a reference when you inevitably get stuck.</p>
<p>Do this and watch your gains fly to the moon.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/when-you-add-a-project-to-your-portfolio.jpeg" alt="when-you-add-a-project-to-your-portfolio"></p>
<h2 id="imnewtowebdevelopmentwheredoistart">I'm New to Web Development, Where Do I Start?</h2>
<p>I can't emphasize this enough–<strong><em>pick a project</em></strong>!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/pick-any-project.jpeg" alt="pick-any-project"></p>
<p>After that, the process is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn <em>just</em> enough to move forward</li>
<li>Get stuck</li>
<li>Learn <em>just</em> enough to move forward</li>
</ul>
<p>Over and over again.</p>
<p>It's maddeningly simple, that's why hardly anyone does it. We look for a grand, overly-complex system that'll "drive us to success", while ignoring this timeless principle...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find something you can't do, and figure out how to do it. Whatever it takes.</p>

<h2 id="theultimatebeginnerproject">The Ultimate Beginner Project</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/todo-mvc-1.png" alt="todo-mvc-1"></p>
<p>In my opinion, TodoMVC is the ultimate beginner project. It's conceptually simple, yet has an interesting design and nice amount of functionality.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add todos</li>
<li>Edit todos by double-clicking</li>
<li>Delete todos</li>
<li>Check/Uncheck todos</li>
<li>Filters for complete/active todos</li>
<li>Counts how many todos are left</li>
<li>Todos are saved to LocalStorage</li>
</ol>
<p>Code a pixel-perfect copy in HTML/CSS, then implement the functionality in JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/07/todo-mvc.gif" alt="todo-mvc"></p>
<p>Do whatever it takes to get this done. If you buy a book or course, it's <em>specifically</em> to complete TodoMVC.</p>
<p>You shouldn't need any though. Google and FreeCodeCamp are perfect resources, and their total cost is $0.</p>
<p>As a professional web developer, I've personally used TodoMVC to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharpen my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.</li>
<li>Learn React two weeks before starting my role as a Lead React developer.</li>
<li>Acquaint myself with a whole new programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever you are, whatever you're learning, TodoMVC is the perfect introductory project.</p>
<p>After that, pick something new or even a harder version TodoMVC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to sign in with GitHub</li>
<li>Save users' todos in a database</li>
<li>Show them next time they log in</li>
<li>Fall back to LocalStorage if they don't want to sign in</li>
</ul>
<p>The complexity can scale almost indefinitely. If you hate todo lists for whatever reason, fine. My advice still stands—<strong>pick a project</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="whataboutresumegithubetc">What About Resume, GitHub, etc?</h2>
<p>These are your finishing touches.</p>
<p>First lay a strong foundation of quality projects, then feature them everywhere–on your GitHub, Resume, LinkedIn, personal website.</p>
<p>For extra credit, learn to use Git/GitHub as you're doing the project. The workflow will eventually feel comfortable, and you'll be simulating a work environment much closer.</p>
<p>Whether it's open source, a meetup, or by yourself, just do lots of projects.</p>
