<p>Over the years of teaching V School has developed a learning philosophy that can be best described with  <code>The easy way is the hard way.</code> It means that solving problems and challenges is the best way to learn. Naturally, this course will have <em>a lot</em> of hands-on practice</p>
<p>Most of the tutorials will be on Scrimba, but there will also be links to a few external resources, like assignments and how-to videos for a handful of topics.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you to don't binge-watch the course. Make sure you take frequent breaks, sleep on the problems and take your time.</p>
<h3 id="tipsforthestudentsofthesecourse">Tips for the students of these course:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do rewatch screencasts if you're not sure about something. It doesn't mean you're bad at learning or remembering.</li>
<li>Try to use your knowledge and it's ok to stray away to try something out and come back to the course.</li>
<li>Learning shouldn't be lonely. Find help by searching online, asking a friend or a classmate, reaching out to an instructor.</li>
</ul>
<p>V School has also been generous enough to create <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/v-school-module-0/shared_invite/enQtNjYxNTk5OTIyNTk1LTBkYmJiYTVkYWFmZDhkZjA0N2FlOWVlNmY4MTA2NTQyNzE3ZWZjMDdhNjZmNmFlZWUyMWQ0N2NjZGY2MjVlYTM">a dedicated slack channel</a> for you to ask for help and help others. Please join and let's build a community around this course!</p>
<h1 id="howtousescrimba">How to Use Scrimba</h1>
<p>It's best to see something once than a hundred times to read about. If you're not familiar with how Scrimba works, <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cQ942nhN?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">watch our screencast</a>, where Bob Ziroll, Director of Education at V School walks you through it.</p>
<h1 id="externallinkcomputersetup">External Link - Computer Setup</h1>
<p>Before we start with the course, we need to have some your computer set up. Feel free to <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/c9PnvGCp?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">jump in our screencast</a> to learn how to do that.</p>
<h1 id="externallinkusingvscode">External Link - Using VS Code</h1>
<p>At some point in the course, you will need to be able to write some of the code in an editor offline. We normally recommend VSCode, but really any code editor will do. If you'd like to follow the installation steps, you can <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cLrn2zH8?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">find them in our video.</a></p>
<h1 id="previewthevschoolprecourseproject">Preview: the V School Pre-course Project</h1>
<p>This course is free and open to anyone. It also has a capstone project in the end, that can double as V School's pre-course project for anybody interested in applying.</p>
<p>So if you're thinking about joining V School or are on the fence about bootcamps, in general, this course is also for you.</p>
<h1 id="introductiontohtml">Introduction to HTML</h1>
<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/67iys40ry16p4acqtoor.png" alt="Nate Jensen"></p>
<p>In this screencast, Nate Jensen, V School's instructor, is going to introduce us to the basic HTML concepts: boilerplate, tags and HTML syntax.</p>
<h1 id="htmlelements">HTML Elements</h1>
<p>Continuing on the previous chapter's intro, next up are the most common HTML elements, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, etc.</p>
<h1 id="htmlattributes">HTML Attributes</h1>
<p>In this chapter, Nate will cover HTML attributes. Some HTML elements, like a tag for an image <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> has source attribute <code>src</code>. An anchor tag <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> has <code>href</code>. Attributes add extra functionality to our elements.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentsillyciapart1">Assignment - Silly CIA part 1</h1>
<p>This is <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cmkeLgAM?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">our first assignment</a> and you should attempt to complete it yourself without cutting corners such as copypasting code, even if it might take you quite some time to complete it. Having said that, if you get stuck always reach out to other people either on Scrimba, or the V School's coursework page.</p>
<h1 id="html5semantictags">HTML5 Semantic Tags</h1>
<p>In this chapter, Nate covers what semantic tags are and why there were introduced in HTML5.</p>
<h1 id="cssintroinlinestyle">CSS Intro (inline-style)</h1>
<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/xjvkal2lunlefdhriqou.png" alt="Grant Wilhelm"></p>
<p>In this cast, Grant Wilhelm, V School's instructor shows us how we can add styling to HTML elements by writing them inline using <code>style</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div style="color:red;font-size:55px"&gt;Welcome to CSS!&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1 id="cssselectors">CSS Selectors</h1>
<p>In this part, Grant shows us how to link a separate stylesheet with <code>link</code> tag.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And then Grant introduces styling with selectors as a better alternative to inline styling from the previous chapter.</p>
<p>For example, to target an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag in our <code>styles.css</code> file we can write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
color: Blue;
font-size: 55px;
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="assignmentsillyciapart2">Assignment - Silly CIA part 2</h1>
<p>This is <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/silly-cia-part-2/">our next self-driven assignment</a> and similar to the first one, you're highly advised to not cut corners and reach out if stuck for too long.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentcsswarstheselectorawakens">Assignment - CSS Wars: The Selector Awakens</h1>
<p>Congratulations on completing the previous assignment! Nothing pushes your skills further than a good challenge. Keep it up and dive straight into <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/css-wars-the-selector-awakens/">your next assignment.</a></p>
<h1 id="csscolorsandfonts">CSS Colors and Fonts</h1>
<p>Welcome to your next CSS cast, we hope you've enjoyed your challenge.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will learn that to define colors in CSS, we have quite a few options, apart from just writing the color's name.</p>
<p>We can use hexadecimal (hex, for short) notation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">body {
background-color: #a4f6b9;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying via red, green, blue values with <code>rgb</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.header {
background-color: rgb(55, 155, 255);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or with <code>rgba</code> where <code>a</code> is an alpha parameter that is a number between 0.0, fully transparent, and 1.0, fully opaque.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.header {
background-color: rgba(55, 155, 255, 0.5);
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="cssdisplayproperty">CSS Display Property</h1>
<p>When using HTML we're going to be talking about <em>block</em> elements that take up the full width of the page, and <em>inline</em> elements that only take up as much as they need.</p>
<p>Oftentimes, we might want to override the defaults. For example, if we wish to display a few images one under the other, rather than side by side.</p>
<p>We can do this default by using <code>display</code> property.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* img by default is an inline element */
img {
display: block;
height: 175px;
width: 175px;
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="signupforouremaillist">Sign up for our Email List</h1>
<p>This might be a perfect time to interject and offer to stay in touch and get the latest updates from V School. <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/czNJ4vue?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">You can sign up in our screencast.</a></p>

<p>Welcome to <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/block-vs-inline-newsies/">your next challenge</a>! If you're getting stuck, make sure that you go back and rewatch some of the previous screencasts, otherwise, you've got this!</p>
<h1 id="cssboxmodel">CSS Box Model</h1>
<p>In this screencast, Grant will introduce CSS box model.</p>
<p><img src="https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/lvhmh5akyu2wc3511sxo.png" alt="CSS Box Model"></p>
<h1 id="assignmentcolorgridfromscratch">Assignment - Color Grid From Scratch</h1>
<p>It's time for <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/color-grid-from-scratch/">our new assignment</a> and when you're done we'll be looking forward to continuing with the course in the next lesson.</p>
<h1 id="csslayoutandpositioning">CSS Layout and Positioning</h1>
<p>In this screencast, Grant will help us to learn the principles of layout and positioning with CSS. For example, how to overlap elements, make some of them sticky on the page, etc.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentcssflags">Assignment - CSS Flags</h1>
<p>In <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/css-flags/">the next assignment</a> you will be asked to build some countries' flags with pure CSS! When in doubt, fall back and rewatch some of the casts from before and see you in the next assignment.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentdesignablog">Assignment - Design a Blog</h1>
<p><a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/design-a-blog/">Our next assignment</a> will be slightly different, as you can very easily personalise it and have it as a basis for your actual real-life blog in the future!</p>
<h1 id="externallinkdebuggingintro">External Link - Debugging Intro</h1>
<p>The skill of debugging is extraordinarily important in web development. What are bugs and some ways on how to find them <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cR4EdJhM?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">in our screencast.</a></p>
<h1 id="externallinkchromedevtools">External Link - Chrome Dev Tools</h1>
<p>The Developer Tools in your browser of choice will be one of the most important tools you will need to learn. Check out <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cK2MdPAP?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">our primer on the topic.</a></p>
<h1 id="externallinkusinggoogle">External Link - Using Google</h1>
<p>We're quite sure that you are very familiar with using Google to search for things. We've collected <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cy6grKhd?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">a few tips on how to search efficiently</a>, so do check it out.</p>
<h1 id="javascriptdatatypes">Javascript Data Types</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to the Javascript part of the course, where our old friend Nate, will help us write our first lines of Javascript. Nate will introduce <em>primitive</em> and <em>complex</em> data types.</p>
<p>Primitives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>strings, e.g <code>"hello"</code></li>
<li>numbers, e.g <code>2</code>, <code>3</code></li>
<li>booleans, e.g <code>true</code> or <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Complex are combinations of primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li>array, e.g <code>[1, 2, true, "hello"]</code></li>
<li>objects, e.g <code>{likes: "travel", countries_visited: 21, has_passport: true}</code></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="assignmentgrocerystorejs">Assignment - Grocery Store JS</h1>
<p>Congrats! You have reached <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cGe23Wcv?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">your first Javascript assignment</a>. Do reach out if you get stuck and, more importantly, have fun!</p>
<h1 id="javascriptarrays">Javascript Arrays</h1>
<p>Welcome back to our next cast. Nate dives a little deeper into arrays and shows how to access various elements of an array and determine its length.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">//        0        1       2        3         4
var colors = ['blue', 'green', 'red', 'yellow', 'purple'];
console.log(colors[1]); // green
console.log(colors.length); // 5
</code></pre>
<h1 id="javascriptconditionals">Javascript Conditionals</h1>
<p>In this screencast, Nate will help us learn how to add logic to our Javascript programs.</p>
<p>Often, we would like to do something only if something else is in the right place. For example, if the user's birthday is on the day they are looking at your page, show them a confetti animation :)</p>
<p>For that, we would use <em>conditionals</em>.</p>
<p>Nate will walk us through all the <code>if</code>, <code>else if</code> and <code>else</code>, how they are used and more.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentifstatementolympics">Assignment - If Statement Olympics</h1>
<p>Great, time to practice those if-statements with <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cWQe8duV?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">the next JS assignment</a></p>
<h1 id="javascriptloops">Javascript Loops</h1>
<p>Another common thing in programming is to repeat a certain operation for a number of times. You don't have to copy-paste code for the number of times you need it done, because there are <em>loops</em> for that.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">for (i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
// your code you wish to repeat
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nate will let teach us all about <code>for</code> loops, and even how you can supercharge them with <em>conditionals</em> from the previous lesson.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentevenoddlooping">Assignment - Even/Odd Looping</h1>
<p>Nice one! <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cryP79CM?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">Let's now practice loops.</a> Be sure to not cut corners and seek help if stuck. Good luck and have fun.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentloopsandarrayspractice">Assignment - Loops And Arrays Practice</h1>
<p>All right! Let's now do a very common programming task and <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/loops-and-arrays-practice/">practice loops and arrays together.</a></p>
<h1 id="javascriptfunctionspart1">Javascript Functions part 1</h1>
<p>Remember how we talked about not having to copy-paste code in the chapter about loops? Well, a programming term for that is <em>DRY</em>, Don't Repeat Yourself.</p>
<p><em>Functions</em> are used when we have a piece of code that we would like to reuse, in multiple places.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">function sum(x, y) {
console.log(x + y);
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="javascriptfunctionspart2">Javascript Functions part 2</h1>
<p>Great, now when we know how to make a function, how do we use it? A term for using a function is <em>calling</em> a function.</p>
<p>We can call the function from the previous chapter</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">sum(2, 2); //displays 4
</code></pre>
<p>More on calling, how to store results of a function and how to combine them with loops, <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cmkJgRTd?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">in this chapter's screencast</a> with Nate.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentfunctionsexercise">Assignment - Functions Exercise</h1>
<p>Welcome back! <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/exercise-functions/">We now have an exercise to practice functions.</a> Reach out if you're stuck, have fun and good luck.</p>
<h1 id="javascriptobjectspart1">Javascript Objects Part 1</h1>
<p>It's now time to cover Javascript objects. If you didn't see the point of them after the chapter on data structures, we will cover them in-depth now.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// to create an object
var person = {
name: 'Rick',
age: 70,
relation: 'grandfather'
};
// to access a property, use '.' dot notation
console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.age);
</code></pre>
<p>You would often hear people say <em>key-value pair</em> when they talk about properties and their values.</p>
<h1 id="javascriptobjectspart2">Javascript Objects Part 2</h1>
<p>You can also create properties on existing objects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var car = {
type: 'Honda',
make: 'Civic',
wheels: 4,
honk
};
car.hasHadAccident = true;
console.log(car.hasHadAccident); // displays true
</code></pre>
<p>And some properties can be assigned to functions</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var car = {
type: 'Honda',
make: 'Civic',
wheels: 4,
honk: function() {
console.log('HOOOOONK');
}
};
car.honk(); // HOOOOONK
</code></pre>
<h1 id="assignmentsocialjs">Assignment - Social JS</h1>
<p><a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cVyzKDfD?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">Our next assignment</a> will help you write more complex data structures and help you think how about them.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentloopolympics">Assignment - Loop Olympics</h1>
<p>Welcome back again, <a href="https://coursework.vschool.io/loop-olympics/">the next exercise</a> will give you additional practice on using and creating for loops.</p>
<h1 id="javascriptconventions">Javascript Conventions</h1>
<p>Javascript is a very dynamic language and there are many ways to do things. Over the years developers have come up with a set of go-to rules and generally, everybody tends to follow them. These include ways to name variables and functions, use of whitespace, where and how to use comments, etc.</p>
<p>Nate shares these important rules of courtesy among the developers <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/c7zvQMfk?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">in our screencast</a>, do check it out.</p>
<h1 id="assignmentdailyplaneteditor">Assignment - Daily Planet Editor</h1>
<p>We now have <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cwyzqPUz?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">another exercise to complete.</a> This assignment will have you clone down a repository from GitHub that has some javascript code inside. The code is plagued with bad JS conventions, and your goal is to clean it up<br>
and make sure it runs correctly.</p>
<h1 id="introductiontothedom">Introduction to the DOM</h1>
<p>So far we were learning about Javascript, but how does it apply to the actual web development?</p>
<p>Javascript comes in when you need to programmatically update your HTML and CSS. To add interactivity and makes things happen on your page.</p>
<p>In this screencast, Bob explains how this can be achieved.</p>
<h1 id="whatisthedom">What is the DOM?</h1>
<p>DOM stands for "Document Object Model". It's essentially a set of tools that are given to developers to be able to change the page programmatically. The DOM is simply an object, on which we can use different methods and properties to make changes to the page.</p>
<p>The way we access the DOM is by adding a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to the page with our <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;What is the DOM?&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is the DOM?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then inside <code>index.js</code> file, we can access the DOM by using <code>document</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">console.log(document);
</code></pre>
<h1 id="assignmentlogdocumenttotheconsole">Assignment - log <code>document</code> to the console</h1>
<p>This is going to be a short one. For <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/cy6g7zCM?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">your next assignment</a> try to build a basic HTML page from scratch, try to log <code>document</code> and look what actually gets logged in the console.</p>
<h1 id="selectingelementsgetelementbyid">Selecting Elements - getElementById</h1>
<p>In this cast, Bob shows us how we can select a specific DOM element by a provided <code>id</code> on the element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- We specify id for h1 --&gt;
&lt;h1 id="hello"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;script src="index.pack.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And now we can select that element with Javascript</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var hello = document.getElementById('hello');
console.log(hello); // &lt;h1 id="hello"&gt;
</code></pre>
<h1 id="assignmentgetelementbyid">Assignment - getElementById</h1>
<p>Welcome to <a href="https://scrimba.com/p/pG66Msa/c27rwau4?utm_source=dev.to&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gbootcampprep_launch_article">the next exercise</a>. In this one you will practice some DOM manipulation and also attempt to solve a problem that you haven't been introduced before. No worries, any search engine is your friend!</p>
<h1 id="selectingmultipleelements">Selecting Multiple Elements</h1>
<p>In this chapter, Bob shows us how to select multiple DOM elements. You really have a selection in this case. Elements could be selected by their id, class name or tag name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1 class="things"&gt;Thing 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class="things"&gt;Thing 2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 class="things"&gt;Thing 3&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">var things = document.getElementsByClassName('things');
console.log(things); // HTMLCollection with 3 elements.
</code></pre>
<h1 id="queryselectorandqueryselectorall">querySelector and querySelectorAll</h1>
<p>There is also another way that can help us select elements and it could be used with all three: tags, ids and class names.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">document.querySelector('#favorite-things'); // returns the first element that matches the id
document.querySelectorAll('#favorite-things'); // returns all elements that match the id
</code></pre>
<h1 id="modifyinganelementstext">Modifying an element's text</h1>
<p>It's all well and good to be able to select elements, but it's really useful to be able to update them once selected. One of the most common usages is updating some text with Javascript.</p>
<p>In this chapter, Bob covers a few ways and looks at their pros and cons. One of them is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p id="paragraph"&gt;PLACEHOLDER&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">document.querySelector('#paragraph').textContent = "I've changed!";
</code></pre>
<h1 id="modifyingstyles">Modifying Styles</h1>
<p>If we can modify some text, the same applies to modifying styles.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1 id="header"&gt;Modifying Styles with JS&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">var header = document.getElementById('header');
header.style.color = 'blue'; // header changes color to blue
</code></pre>
<h1 id="modifyingstylesclassnameandclasslist">Modifying Styles - className and classList</h1>
<p>Often you might not want to change a style permanently. It's common to change colors depending on some event or input for some time and then return it to a default position. For example, you're inputting a text in a field, you might want to highlight that box's edges.</p>
<p>This is a perfect case for adding and removing a class.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;h1 id="header" class="title another"&gt;Modifying Styles with JS&lt;/h1&gt;

<h1 id="modifyingelementsvalue">Modifying elements - value</h1>
<p>While we're on the subject of modifying elements, <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> tag deserves our special attention. It's a bit of an odd one out, as it doesn't have <code>textContent</code> property and the way you would access what the user has typed into an input field is with <code>value</code> property.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;input type="text" id="text-input" /&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">var inputBox = document.getElementById('text-input');
console.log(inputBox.value); // will log user's input
</code></pre>
<h1 id="creatingelementsinjs">Creating elements in JS</h1>
<p>If we can modify an element, why not create it?</p>
<p>We can do it with <code>createElement()</code> function.</p>
<p>For example, if we have a list</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;ul id="my-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>We can add another <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// create a new list element
var newLi = document.createElement('li');
// add an order number inside, so it looks like &lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;
newLi.textContent = '3';
//select the existing list
var myList = document.getElementById('my-list');
// add the newly created li to the list.
myList.append(newLi);
</code></pre>
<h1 id="creatingelementsinjsinnerhtml">Creating elements in JS - innerHTML</h1>
<p>The approach Bob has shown us in the previous chapter is the go-to way. But in this chapter, he shows us that for such quick operations we can simplify the code by using <code>innerHtml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var myList = document.getElementById('my-list');
// innerHTML is a string represantation, which is why it's possible to just add another element.
myList.innerHTML += '&lt;li&gt;3&lt;/li&gt;';
</code></pre>
<h1 id="creatingelementsinjsforloopscreateelement">Creating elements in JS - for loops + createElement</h1>
<p>Ok, let's now apply what we've learnt.</p>
<p>We can combine our knowledge of loops with <code>createElement</code> to display information on the screen.</p>
<p>Imagine you're having a party and you've sent the invitations. When someone agrees to come, you'd like to show their names on a page. This list of people can change. So different users might see different information depending on when they saw your page.</p>
<p>Let's see how it can be done</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;ul id="guests"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// my guests
var partyGuests = [
'Jason Lee Scott',
'Kimberly Hart',
'Zack Taylor',
'Trini Kwan',
'Billy Cranston'
];
// grab the list
var guestList = document.getElementById('guests');
// for every guest in the partyGuests array
for (var i = 0; i &lt; partyGuests.length; i++) {
// create a list element for each
var newName = document.createElement('li');
// and guest's name to the list element
newName.textContent = partyGuests[i];
// add the list element to my list of guests
guestList.append(newName);
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="eventlisteners">Event Listeners</h1>
<p>All of the DOM modifications we've learnt so far were leading up to this very chapter. A lot of the changes usually depend on a user interacting with your page.</p>
<p>This brings us to <em>events</em> and <em>event listeners</em>. Events are clicks, hovers, keyboard presses, the usual ways people interact with web pages. Event listeners are special bits of code that wait for those events and then trigger your code when something happens.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example of a button.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;button id="button"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;script src="index.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">var button = document.getElementById('button');
// add an vent listener for clicks
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
// when a user clicks the button, run this function.
console.log('The button was clicked!');
});
</code></pre>
