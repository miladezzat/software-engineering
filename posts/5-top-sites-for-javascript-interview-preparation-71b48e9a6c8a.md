<p>Looking for a new job is a daunting task. There are so many things to consider when trying to find the perfect role - location, company, job responsibilities, pay and compensation, training and much more.</p>
<p>When you finally find the perfect job you want to make sure that you maximise your chances of getting an offer. Here are some resources for checking your JavaScript, Node.js, React and Redux knowledge that I’m confident would help you ace your JavaScript interview.</p>
<h4 id="37-essential-javascript-interview-questions"><a href="https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions" rel="noopener">37 Essential JavaScript Interview Questions</a></h4>
<p>This is one of my favourite resources for practicing JavaScript questions. I really like it because the answers are hidden by default, giving you a chance to go through and test yourself before viewing any of the answers.</p>
<p>It tests everything from definitions to ‘what does this code produce’ to ‘write a function that does this’. It’s great for everyone, no matter whether you’re a front end, back end or full stack developer.</p>
<h4 id="top-50-react-interview-questions-to-prepare-for-this-year"><a href="https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/react-interview-questions/amp/" rel="noopener">Top 50 React Interview Questions To Prepare For This Year</a></h4>
<p>This site is great for a mix of React and Redux questions. It has a really good explanation of the virtual DOM and covers the differences between React and Angular, and React component life cycles. The Redux section has questions testing your knowledge on the whole process.</p>
<h4 id="node-js-interview-questions-and-answers"><a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/node-js-interview-questions-and-answers-2017/" rel="noopener">Node.js Interview Questions and Answers</a></h4>
<p>RisingStack is a great website for Node.js developers, whether you have a job or are just applying. This article has 10 questions about async coding, testing and general Node.js practices. It lists each of the questions at the start to give you a chance to answer for yourself before seeing the answers.</p>
<h4 id="8-essential-node-js-interview-questions"><a href="https://www.toptal.com/nodejs/interview-questions" rel="noopener">8 Essential Node.js Interview Questions</a></h4>
<p>This is another set of questions from Toptal, so it has a nice drop down answer functionality. Some of the questions are similar to other articles but there are a few really good, unique questions. I definitely learnt a few new things from reading the answers.</p>
<h4 id="21-essential-javascript-interview-questions"><a href="https://www.codementor.io/nihantanu/21-essential-javascript-tech-interview-practice-questions-answers-du107p62z" rel="noopener">21 Essential JavaScript Interview Questions</a></h4>
<p>This site has a good list of JavaScript interview questions with questions that I hadn’t found on any of the other sites. Some of them are more obscure but I could definitely imagine them being asked in a technical interview if they were trying to catch you out.</p>
<h4 id="you-don-t-know-js-kyle-simpson"><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md" rel="noopener">You Don’t Know JS - Kyle Simpson</a></h4>
<p>This one is different from the rest. It’s not a list of questions but a book series. I’ve added this to the list because it’s all good being able to rope learn some definitions and questions, it’s another to truly understand what’s happening.</p>
<p>This book series has taught me more about JavaScript than any other single resource. There are 6 books in the series and they become progressively more complex. When you understand closures, callbacks or promises, any interview question on it becomes simple, whether finding a bug, giving a description or just discussing with the interviewer.</p>
<p>This will be extra useful as it will aid you in you new job, not just the interview process. It is also free to read online as well as available in paper copy.</p>
