<h3 id="my-intention-with-publishing-this-collection">My intention with publishing this collection</h3><p>Last year I only used Medium for <strong>consuming content</strong>, and I checked out a ton of Python-related articles. Recently I’ve started to use the <strong>community<em> </em>features </strong>of the platform, for instance following fellow developers. I also developed the practice of clapping and highlighting the most interesting parts of their articles. <strong>My goal is to be an active member</strong> of the developer community gathered on Medium.</p><p>I also realized that I would like to <strong>give back to the community </strong>after reading so many great resources. This was one of my main motivations for writing my first article <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-you-need-python-environments-and-how-to-manage-them-with-conda-85f155f4353c" rel="noopener">“Why you need Python environments and how to manage them with Conda”</a>.</p><p>In this article, I’d like to share with you the <strong>articles I found most interesting and insightful (inspiring) last year and this year (so far)</strong>. My other goal was to create a comprehensive list of the most valuable pieces<strong> for my Python students</strong>.</p><h3 id="how-to-navigate-this-article">How to navigate this article</h3><p>I bookmarked so many great resources that it was not easy to select the best ones. So I divided the article into<strong> 10 categories</strong> — this, by the way, resonates well with the <strong>versatile and multipurpose nature of Python</strong>.</p><p>The categories are:</p><p><a href="#c30e" rel="noopener">1. General Python programming</a></p><p><a href="#90ec" rel="noopener">2. Python performance optimization</a></p><p><a href="#e770" rel="noopener">3. Python development environments and DevOps</a></p><p><a href="#58ae" rel="noopener">4. Machine learning</a></p><p><a href="#9d56" rel="noopener">5. Image and video processing</a></p><p><a href="#6b5e" rel="noopener">6. Chatbots and Natural language processing (NLP)</a></p><p><a href="#a782" rel="noopener">7. Blockchain</a></p><p><a href="#0e75" rel="noopener">8. Web and backend development</a></p><p><a href="#2b67" rel="noopener">9. Web scraping</a></p><p><a href="#c6cd" rel="noopener">10. Data visualization</a></p><p>Just one more thing before you dive in: <strong>how should you use this article</strong>? It doesn’t need to be read all at once. <strong>Bookmark it</strong>, and use it as a starting point or a reference point. With the <strong>category list above, you can navigate</strong> to the sections that you are interested in most.</p><p>And please <strong>let me know in a comment</strong> if you feel that I left out an awesome resource so I can update my collection. Thanks in advance!</p><h3 id="1-general-python-programming">1.
