<p>Today, the freeCodeCamp community turns 1,000 days old. We’ve accomplished a lot together in that time:</p><ul><li>6,000+ campers have gotten their first developer job.</li><li>8,000+ other campers — who already had developer jobs — have used their new skills to get promoted or transition into even better jobs.</li><li>Campers now code together at freeCodeCamp study groups in 2,000+ cities around the world.</li><li>Together, campers have built open source tools used by dozens of nonprofits.</li><li>The community now runs <a href="https://fcc.im/2tFIKpR" rel="noopener">Medium’s largest technology publication</a>.</li><li>The community now runs a popular <a href="https://fcc.im/2tFvCBf" rel="noopener">YouTube channel</a>.</li><li>Thousands of people get help with coding every day on the <a href="https://fcc.im/2sNa8iF" rel="noopener">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.</li></ul><p>1,000 days ago today, I launched a prototype from a desk in my closet. I wasn’t sure whether anyone would want to come code with me.</p><p>Well today, freeCodeCamp is a community of more than a million campers, driven by the contributions of thousands of passionate volunteers.</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of the community, anyone on Earth with an internet connection can now learn to code for free, at their own pace. freeCodeCamp has become a proven path to a first developer job.</p><p>And we’re just getting started. Here are some of our goals for the next 1,000 days of freeCodeCamp:</p><ul><li>An expanded curriculum that covers topics like testing and security, with additional certificates</li><li>A coding interview preparation tool with thousands of algorithm and data structure challenges, and hundreds of projects for extra practice</li><li>Concept guides for important subjects like math, computer science, and design, and advanced topics like machine learning and blockchain</li><li>Dozens more Open Source for Good tools, which will save nonprofits millions of dollars in software costs</li></ul><p>All of this — including the verified certificates — will remain 100% free.</p><p>freeCodeCamp is a donor-supported nonprofit. If you want to help us improve even faster, you can help us cover servers and other costs by <a href="https://fcc.im/2tblnB1" rel="noopener">setting up a donation you can afford</a>.</p><p>Thanks for being part of the freeCodeCamp community.</p><p>Here’s to another exciting 1,000 days!</p>
